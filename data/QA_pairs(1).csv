"Why is the ""Black Death"" mentioned so often in western history but not Chinese history even though it originated there?","I have an unpublished paper on this subject that sheds some light. I will summarize:  We have some interesting demographic data from the early 14th century in China showing the outbreak of various epidemics. These were very significant, and were certainly contributing factors to the demise of the Yuen dynasty. I say various because it is unclear from the documents whether the outbreaks were the same disease. Many of the surviving documents are brief, reporting only deaths.  So, we cannot say definitively whether the black death existed in China or not, but there was/were disease(s) at the right time, and it/they knocked out a significant chunk of the population.  EDIT: I realize this is ambiguous - the paper is not mine, my thesis advisor from grad school wrote it.","The term ""Black Death"" is often mentioned in Western history, but not in Chinese history, despite the fact that the plague originated in China around 7th century AD. There are several reasons for this:

1. **Chinese records**: The Chinese have a long and detailed record of the plague, which dates back to the 7th century AD. The Chinese historian Sun Tzu wrote about the plague in his book ""The Art of War,"" which is a historical treatise on military strategy and tactics. The Chinese also kept records of the plague for many centuries, which provide valuable information about its spread and impact.
2. **More detailed records**: The Chinese records of the plague are more detailed and comprehensive than those of the Western world. The Chinese records describe the plague as a major public health crisis, with widespread outbreaks, epidemics, and even the deaths of millions of people. The Chinese also kept records of the plague's spread, including maps of the affected areas and descriptions of the disease's symptoms.
3. **Early European records**: While the Chinese have a long record of the plague, the first European records of the disease were not until the 12th century AD. These early European records were based on the accounts of Christian missionaries and travelers, who had visited the plague-ridden regions of the Middle East and Asia. The European accounts of the plague were often sensationalized and exaggerated, which further solidified the ""Black Death"" label.
4. **Medieval European literature**: The ""Black Death"" was also perpetuated by medieval European literature, particularly in the works of medieval scholars and theologians. These writers often used the plague as a metaphor for the corrupting influence of sin and the dangers of unchecked power and corruption.
5. **Historical narrative**: The narrative of the ""Black Death"" has been shaped by Western historical narratives, which often focus on the horrors of war, disease, and death. The ""Black Death"" has been used as a symbol of the horrors of the Middle Ages, and has been invoked to justify the persecution of minority groups, the suppression of dissent, and the persecution of heretics.

In contrast, Chinese history has been shaped by a different narrative, which emphasizes the importance of social hierarchy, moral values, and the balance of yin and yang. The Chinese have a rich tradition of storytelling and historiography, which often focus on the development of Confucianism, the rise of the Han Dynasty, and the spread of Buddhism.

Overall, the ""Black Death"" label has been perpet","The Black Death is a very famous event in European history. It was a major factor in the rise of the nation-states of Europe. It's not like that in China. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China. It was in Europe, and it's not like that in Asia. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China.  If you're interested in reading more about the Black Death, I recommend the book *The Plague* by Robin Brooks. It's a great read, and it's very well written.<|eot_id|>",There is no black death in chinese history at all. __________________posted by dr. Stephen l. Voisin at 5:29 pm,"~~chinese people didn't kill the black people.~~ in china, the concept of killing the people was a common practice, and the term ""han chu"" refers to killing people that were not actually people of color. However, it is important to note that the phrase ""hangu"" is a contraction of ""china"" and not a ""linguistic chimp"". So it's not really a reference to the chin dynasty, but rather to ""taiwan"" as the name implies. As for why ""the black death"", that's a bit of a loaded question. Is it a term for the same thing as ""dying of old age"", or just a modern term? In some cases, a historical term can be used to describe the death of someone, which is not necessarily the case in others. In other cases it can refer to a specific person, or a particular culture, as well as a general historical concept. This is because it isn't a broad term, per se. But it does give you some insight into the history of the word ""death"", and how it was used in various cultures and societies. For example, you might ask this question in [this thread](_url_0_) if you're interested in more details. Edit: there are also some other posts about the actual ""why the terms ""hun"" in the hangu and ""ang chinyu and han chui, ""shen"" (chin chiang yinglai"" or ""khen"", which are used as historical terms, respectively, not ""white"" of people who died of starvation or old people, by the time, in particular cultures.

How historically accurate is the show The Last Kingdom on Netflix?,Specific follow up - Does it make any sense at all that King Alfred wears a fleur-de-lis crown before the Norman conquest?,"The Last Kingdom, a historical drama series based on Bernard Cornwell's novels, is known for its meticulous attention to historical detail. While it's not a completely accurate portrayal of historical events, it does strive to be as accurate as possible within the constraints of its storytelling and characterizations.

Here are some aspects where the show is historically accurate and where it takes creative liberties:

Historically accurate:

1. **Period setting**: The show's production team meticulously recreates the 9th-century England of the time period, including the clothing, architecture, and social structures.
2. **Warrior culture**: The Vikings are portrayed as a warrior society, with a strong emphasis on martial skills, raids, and battles.
3. **Feudal society**: The show accurately depicts the feudal society of 9th-century England, including the social hierarchy, land ownership, and the role of the nobility.
4. **Christianity**: The show represents Christianity during this period, with the establishment of monasteries and the role of the clergy.
5. **Women's roles**: The show portrays the roles of women in 9th-century England, including their involvement in warfare, trade, and domestic life.

Creative liberties:

1. **Viking mythology**: The show takes creative liberties with the mythology of the Vikings, including the depiction of female warriors and the role of female leaders.
2. **Timeline compression**: The show condenses the timeline of events to fit the 6-season narrative, which may not be entirely accurate.
3. **Characterizations**: The show takes creative liberties with characterizations, including the depiction of certain historical figures and their motivations.
4. **Romanticization of war**: The show portrays war as a romanticized and glamorous aspect of life, which is not entirely accurate.
5. **Dramatization**: The show dramatizes certain events and battles for entertainment value, which may not be entirely accurate.

Overall, The Last Kingdom is a historical drama series that strives to be as accurate as possible within the constraints of its storytelling and characterizations. However, it does take creative liberties to enhance the storytelling and characterizations, making it a unique blend of history and fiction.<|eot_id|>","I've watched the first season of the show and I'm not sure if you are asking for historical accuracy, but I would say that it is mostly accurate, except for the characters. I am not sure if you are asking for accuracy in terms of the setting, but I am sure that the show is mostly accurate in terms of the setting. The show is set in the 9th century, and the show's setting is the 9th century, so it is accurate. The show is set in a very similar time period to the Viking Age, so it is accurate in terms of clothing, weapons, and the like. However, the show is set in a very different time period than the Viking Age, and so it is not accurate in terms of politics, religion, and culture. I'm not sure if you are asking for accuracy in terms of the characters, but I would say that the show is mostly accurate. The characters are mostly based on historical figures, but I don't know if they are accurate.<|eot_id|>","I think the first season is much more accurate than the second season. Also, it's funny that i think this is a show where i'm the one who said, ""i'm so tired of this, i don't want to watch it again."" so i hope that when i watch this season, the fact that there is something about the character that is not so familiar is kind of a big deal. I hope i got the right answer for you. I know that you want me to.","Ianah, i thought you were just getting downvoting the question. I'd like to know if anyone can provide an unbiased answer. The movie was set in the late medieval period, so i think it's safe to assume that it was based around the same time period. It also had a good cast, but i'm not sure how accurate that is. As for why you're asking about the ""last kingdom"" part, there's no particular reason to believe it has any connection to the actual show. Just because something is *based* on the events of the series doesn't mean it doesn *have* any relationship to anything else. And as i understand it, the real answer is that the shows that are based on ""the last king"" are all based off of real events. That means that even if they were based upon real kings, they would still be based entirely on fictional events, and thus they wouldn't be a real show on tv. So you can only answer your question as to whether or not the episodes are *real* episodes, because that would be just as meaningless as asking whether the episode is based in reality. You might as well ask whether they are a fictional series, even though that's the way we think of things. Edit: removed the incorrect sentence. Thank you for the gold!

"If there was a lack of food supply in the world, could we survive of of just vitamins and a high concentration of calories? Or do we HAVE to eat in order to live?","> vitamins and a high concentration of calories What would you call this substance, if not food?","While it's theoretically possible to survive on a high-calorie, vitamin-rich diet, it's not a sustainable or healthy long-term solution for several reasons:

1. **Calorie density**: A high-calorie diet may provide a temporary boost to energy levels, but it's essential to maintain a balanced calorie intake. Consuming excessive calories can lead to weight gain, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of chronic diseases.
2. **Nutrient imbalance**: A high-calorie diet often lacks essential nutrients, such as:
	* Protein: necessary for muscle growth and repair
	* Fiber: supports digestive health and satiety
	* Healthy fats: crucial for brain function and hormone regulation
	* Vitamins and minerals: essential for overall health and well-being
3. **Malnutrition**: Consuming excessive calories can lead to malnutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations like children, pregnant women, and the elderly.
4. **Digestive issues**: A high-calorie diet can cause digestive problems, such as:
	* Constipation
	* Diarrhea
	* Bloating
	* Gas
5. **Social and economic challenges**: A high-calorie diet is often inaccessible to those in poverty or facing food insecurity, leading to social and economic disparities.
6. **Lack of satiety**: A high-calorie diet can lead to overeating and poor food choices, making it difficult to maintain a healthy relationship with food.
7. **Dependence on supplements**: A high-calorie diet may not be sufficient to meet daily nutritional needs, leading to the need for supplements, which can be expensive and potentially toxic.

While it's possible to survive on a high-calorie, vitamin-rich diet for an extended period, it's not a sustainable or healthy solution for several reasons:

1. **Nutrient deficiencies**: A high-calorie diet can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.
2. **Long-term health consequences**: Prolonged consumption of high-calorie, high-vitamin diets can increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as:
	* Obesity
	* Diabetes
	* Cardiovascular disease
	* Certain cancers
3. **Increased risk of chronic diseases**: A high-calorie diet is often linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as:
	* Heart disease
	* Stroke
	* Certain cancers

In conclusion, while a high-calorie, vitamin-rich diet may provide temporary benefits, it's not a sustainable or healthy solution for long-term survival. A balanced and varied","There's a lot of food out there. You just need to have a good supply of it.  I know it sounds crazy, but I've seen people survive on very little food and still have a good supply of it. The problem is, you have to have a good supply of food to begin with. You can't just go out and find a good supply of food. You need to have a good supply of food before you can go out and find it.  You need to have a good supply of food before you can eat it. You need to have a good supply of food before you can find it.  You need to have a good supply of food before you can eat it.  You need to have a good supply of food before you can find it.

If we could live without food, we would not only have food but we also would have a lot of the same problems that we do now. I think the answer is that it's a question of what is going on in our world and what we need to do about it. The last thing you need is to be in a hurry to get anything, especially if you are not eating.","Ianas, the problem with food shortages is that there are a lot of people who just aren't eating enough. The issue with obesity is not that we can't find food, but that it doesn't matter. People will still eat and live. If you want to die, you need to feed your family. There is no such thing as ""no food"" in food. You can starve and die. And if the food shortage is a problem, there's no point in starving to death. That's just the way life works. It's not like we need vitamins to survive. We don't need them. But if we did, we'd just be dead. So, if our food supplies are so poor that they're not enough, why bother starving? We already have the resources to do it. Why waste them? The best way to get food is to use them, and that is what we're doing. When you're starving, it isn't worth it to waste resources. Also, when starving people die of old age, they don’t die because they die without food and food doesn‘t help. They aren“t give you food either. What do you do with them that you dont do? Go die?

"If our DNA varies from person to person, how do we know how closely human DNA resembles that of orangutans?","It's true that if one were to be calculating the *exact* difference, one could only do so between an individual human and an individual orangutan. However, the difference between the two species is so much larger than that between individuals of either species that that latter difference is completely negligible for any useful application for such information. It's like measuring how far the people in Los Angeles are from the people in New York. One could ask ""Which person in Los Angeles and which person in New York?"", but it's pretty irrelevant at that point. You would just say 2400 miles.","Humans and orangutans share a significant amount of DNA, as they both belong to the same species (Homo sapiens and Pongo abelii, respectively). However, the DNA differences between humans and orangutans are relatively small.

Studies have shown that humans and orangutans share around 98% of their DNA, which is the same as humans and chimpanzees. This high degree of genetic similarity is due to the fact that orangutans and humans share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago.

To determine the extent of the DNA similarity between humans and orangutans, scientists use various methods, including:

1. DNA sequencing: This involves analyzing the DNA sequences of individuals from both species and comparing them to identify genetic similarities and differences.
2. Genetic mapping: This involves identifying specific genetic markers or regions in the DNA that are unique to one species.
3. Phylogenetic analysis: This involves using statistical methods to reconstruct the evolutionary history of both species and identify the genetic relationships between them.

One study published in the journal Science in 2016 used DNA sequencing to compare the genomes of humans and orangutans. The results showed that humans and orangutans share around 98% of their DNA, which is the same as humans and chimpanzees.

Another study published in the journal Nature in 2019 used genetic mapping to identify specific genetic markers that are unique to one species. The results showed that humans and orangutans share around 85% of their DNA, with the remaining 15% being unique to each species.

In summary, the DNA similarities between humans and orangutans are relatively small, and the studies mentioned above have shown that they share around 98-85% of their DNA. This is a strong indication that humans and orangutans are closely related species.

Here's a rough estimate of the DNA similarity between humans and orangutans:

- Humans and orangutans share around 98% of their DNA.
- Humans and chimpanzees share around 98% of their DNA.
- Humans and chimpanzees share around 98-85% of their DNA.

Keep in mind that these estimates are based on various studies and may vary depending on the specific methods used. However, they all suggest that humans and orangutans share a significant amount of DNA, indicating a close genetic relationship between the two species.<|eot_id|>","Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes. Each gene has 2 alleles, which are the two versions of the gene. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. The alleles are called *alleles* because they are not the same, but the same type of allele is called a *allele* and the *alleles* themselves are called *alleles*. In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the human chromosome has 46 *alleles*. The orangutan has 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the orangutan chromosome has 46 *alleles*.  So, when we look at the human chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*, and when we look at the orangutan chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*. This means that the orangutan chromosome is 46% similar to the human chromosome, and the human chromosome is 46% similar to the orangutan chromosome.<|eot_id|>","ㅇ㇠ㄅㆅ▶ leader 03/06/15 (tue) 06:02:31 id: 8d0d3d (1) no.304822 >>304746 >>292783 (hide) : file 141285234589.

""i'll show you something special""-dmitri:d. ""dum-dum"" (d) is an adjective that sounds like a name, meaning ""a person with an interest in music"".—d. M. J. E. D. This is just how i see it: the idea of a ""dna"" is what i like about it, i. E. It doesnt feel like it can be used to refer to something else. Dna refers to people who are interested in something, that is, who want to play dms. In other words, the whole idea is that the person who plays ddm will be the one who is interested and interested about that thing, not just the individual who play it (that is the only way of saying that a person can play dm). In my opinion, its the best way to describe dnd, because it seems to work as a combination of dnd and dnb. If you are playing dm or dng, you would use dns as dnt, dnnt and dntn. Just like in dts, there are no ""special"" ddns. You can still play a ddn if you want, though. And since you can't play any dnnn, then you have to have the dnf (dual d-nn) as well as whatever you do. As for how to use the word dnd, just remember that youll be using the name of your own ddn. Your dd is like your ddn, so if your dda is d, your name is your ""buddy"", and your bdn is its ""brother"", then your brother will have its own dda. Also, if the player is playing a nndd, or any other ddb, their ddd is their ""nnddd"", so you will get a nnddb for your ndd. A ddd will never be considered a bnd. They will also have their own bds, as long as they have that ddb in their dds. Since they donnt have all the information about the bdd, they will just have one ddat (the dty), so they can use their ndds as dts and their bdts as bods. Any dtd that has a bdty will use it as its dta, even if it does not have it in its bdlds (as with dtfd). The ddfd will still be called ddt (which is ddtd) if there is no bdt in it so long. Which is why it could be referred to as ""the ddl"".'dnnntngdnddnnnnn' (dntdn) = dngdnngddddndnn(4.5) ddmntdddndddddnnn (dnnt) - dntddnndndndnim not sure what to make of this, since it sounds almost like ddfd (but thatre like the old name for a fddi) and it might be because the ""nndda"" doesn�t have any name in there.

This is, of course, very, **very** limited by the fact that we don't know exactly how our genomes actually look, and we really don’t know what the dandrites in our skin are made of. So if you look at the wikipedia page on human skin, you can see a decent portion of the variation, if not all, in that region.

"Why would a company spend millions on a long Superbowl commercial, only to leak it online a week before the Superbowl?","It's a quick way to build buzz. I mean, here we are discussing it right now. Recognition is also an extremely important part of marketing. That commercial will stand out more than the others now because people will recognize it when it officially airs.","There are several reasons why a company might spend millions on a long Super Bowl commercial and then leak it online a week before the event. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Brand Protection**: Companies may leak their Super Bowl commercial to protect their brand from potential backlash or negative publicity. By releasing the commercial ahead of time, they can mitigate the risk of a negative reaction from fans, critics, or even their own employees.
2. **Pre-Release Strategy**: Companies often have a pre-release strategy to build hype and excitement around their Super Bowl commercial. By releasing it a week before the event, they can create a sense of anticipation and urgency among their fans and employees.
3. **Media Rights**: The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched events in the world, and companies may want to capitalize on this massive audience. By releasing their commercial ahead of time, they can generate buzz and attract media attention, which can help them secure better media rights, such as TV time, streaming deals, or even a prime-time slot.
4. **Employee Engagement**: Companies may leak their Super Bowl commercial to engage their employees and encourage them to participate in the pre-release strategy. This can be a fun and creative way to build a sense of community and excitement among their team members.
5. **PR and Communications**: Companies may leak their Super Bowl commercial to generate positive publicity and build a positive brand image. By releasing the commercial ahead of time, they can create a narrative that showcases their brand's values, personality, or unique selling proposition.
6. **Competition**: The Super Bowl is a highly competitive event, and companies may leak their commercial to stay ahead of their competitors. By releasing the commercial ahead of time, they can gain an advantage in terms of brand awareness, media attention, and customer engagement.
7. **Marketing and Promotion**: Companies may leak their Super Bowl commercial to create a buzz around their brand and products. By releasing the commercial ahead of time, they can promote their brand and products to their existing customers, as well as to new customers who may be interested in their products or services.

It's worth noting that leaking a Super Bowl commercial ahead of time is not uncommon, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Companies may use this strategy to build hype, generate buzz, and create a positive brand image.<|eot_id|>","If you want to get a lot of attention, you want to get people talking about your product.

It's the nature of the beast. But it is a beast, and one that is being exploited by a greedy company with a bad name.1. The poor, the blind and the lame. A new book has been published in the uk that addresses the problem of blind people. A blog post by the writer, mary anne, reveals that blind blind persons can only be represented by their own eyes.2. Blind people are not only stupid. They are also stupid because they can't distinguish between the two. In fact, a blind person cannot distinguish the difference between a person with autism and a child with speech disorders. For example, in one study, blind children were not able to distinguish ""between the words "" and ""fugitive"" in ""the boy and his dog"". 3. There is no way to know if the person has autism or not. It is up to the individual to decide. We can all agree that the most important thing to do is to take care of our blind friends. You can read more about this here .4. All these things can be measured. If we can understand how blind we are, then we will be able be more rational in our decisions. This is where the ""blindness paradox"" comes in.

That is a lot of money for the company. If someone were to sell that play to someone else, they would have to pay for it. Also, i believe they are constantly on the lookout for leaks of plays. They may also be looking for any leaks that might be on their computers or on other media they have access to. I know some companies have a leak protection policy which is really good for their employees but i don't know for sure why they do it or not. It would be very difficult to get an employee to sign off on this. There are also a few reasons why it's a bad idea for them to release a play and not for someone to watch. The biggest one is that you can't see it live in public. You have an enclosed space, so when someone looks at the screen you don’t have time to see the whole thing.

Question about Popes and alliances in 1500's Europe...,"I have a History degree and mostly studied European History..so here is my answer. Since you're reading about 1500s European timeframe, the Pope still had considerable social power over the Catholic majority of Europe ( Protetsantism really didn't become numerically strong until the 1600s in northern europe). The Popes power was not curtailed significantly until the Enlightenment era..He could convince the Spanish Hapsburg Empire ( Catholic) to send his armies anywhere on the continent, and he could be an important asset in the Italian city-states rivalries because the Vatican had considerable economic clout. Their is more to it that I hope other Historians could add on.","In the 1500s, European politics was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church, particularly the papacy. Popes, as the spiritual leaders of the Catholic Church, often formed alliances with other European monarchs and states to achieve their goals.

One notable example is the alliance between Pope Julius II and King Louis XII of France. In 1507, Pope Julius II formed a secret treaty with King Louis XII, which was known as the ""Papal-Louisian Alliance."" This alliance was a powerful statement of Catholic Church support for French interests and a counterbalance to the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire.

The alliance was significant because it:

1. Showed the Pope's influence over European politics.
2. Demonstrated the power of the Catholic Church in shaping European alliances.
3. Highlighted the complex relationships between European monarchs and the papacy.

However, the alliance also had its drawbacks, such as:

1. Limited the Pope's ability to act independently.
2. Created tension between the Pope and the French king, who were not entirely loyal to the Catholic Church.
3. Led to the French king's decision to break the alliance and form a new alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor.

The papal-louisian alliance also had significant consequences for European politics, including:

1. The rise of the French monarchy as a major power in Europe.
2. The decline of the Holy Roman Empire's influence in European politics.
3. The strengthening of the Catholic Church's position in European affairs.

Overall, the papal-louisian alliance was a significant event in 1500s European politics, highlighting the complex relationships between European monarchs and the papacy.<|eot_id|>","The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and as such is the head of the Catholic Church in Europe. He is not a political leader in the way that a king is. His power is more symbolic. His power is the power of the Church. He is the Pope, and he has a lot of influence over the Catholic Church. He is the Pope, and he has a lot of influence over the European monarchs. The Pope is not a political leader, and the Pope is not a monarch. The Pope is the Pope.  So, the Pope is not really in a position to make alliances with monarchs. The Pope is not a political leader, and the Pope is not a monarch. The Pope is the Pope.  He is not a political leader, and he is not a monarch. He is the Pope.<|eot_id|>","A good question. I'm not sure if the answer is a good one, but i think i can get a sense of the historical context. Let's take the same question and say that the most important thing about the time is the general attitude of many people in the 16th century. What is it that makes this attitude so important? It's because of a lot of things. The most obvious is that there were a few monarchs, and the monarchies were more or less independent, independent from each other and from the rest of society. But there was a certain amount of money in circulation, there wasn't a much more powerful king or emperor. And it was very much a way of life for the people. So it's quite obvious that, because the king and emperor were the only ones that were allowed to control the economy. That's why there are so many monarchical monarchists. They're the ones who have the greatest influence on the entire country. This is why the state has a monarchy, which is very important for everybody. You could have a king who is responsible for a whole lot. It's important to remember that this is not just about money. There are other important things that are important, too. For instance, the monarchy was important because it kept the country in peace, it protected the national interest, not only for its own sake, you could say. So, what did you find out about that time?in the beginning, i don't know if you know what a monarch is, if it has to be, or if he has the power to do so. I didn't find it important at all. We have to have an understanding of what the term is. At the end of this period, a couple of people started to say, 'okay, this monarch's name is king david, right? So, we have this king of david.' they were very angry and said, ""well, he's a very powerful man, so what do we do about it?"" i thought, well, maybe we should give him the title of king of israel, instead of having to go through the process of making a new name. Because he was the first to become king, rather than the second one. He didnwhat did he do? He said to the king, with the help of his father, that he wanted to rule all the land, to reign over it, even though he had no right to that. Well, king benjamin, who was also the leader of all these kingdoms, was not going to take any part in this new king's rule. On the contrary, benjamin told him that all of these kings had to make a name for themselves, for their country, their people, all their possessions, as well as their religious beliefs. Then, at that moment, they had this idea, then, of how to deal with this problem. The king said that it would be better if benjamin became the new king. As i recall, in fact, when he heard that idea from benjamin's father in jerusalem, his mind immediately went to israel. When he saw that benjamin was going around the world, from jerusalem to paris, bringing in all sorts of ideas, people were talking about this. In fact he became so very enthusiastic about these ideas. During this time, everything began to change. First, during the period of peace in 1585 and 1586, israel began giving away a large portion of its land to them. Now, before that period in israel's history, jerusalem had become the capital of jerusalem. Before that point, these people had been very well off. Today, however, no one has any land left in their hands. Therefore, on that day, after the war, some people came to jerusalem and asked, how did we get to this point? That was one of those things where they asked the questions, without even knowing it. ""what is this land?"" ""this land of canaan, where we are, is where you are."" and they started asking these questions. However, once they knew the truth, most of them were convinced that we were really going out of our way to get this to what we needed to. Since then we've been talking to a great deal of other people about how we can do this, about what to give up in order to establish this state, like the kingdom of god, palestine, egypt, etc. These people have not been able to understand the way that these things work. One of their ideas was that if we give them this kind of land and give it to us, let us give this country back to it and let them live in it in a free way, thus, since we had given them the right, give us the freedom to live under the law. (and then) they were going crazy. To them, now we're like, okay, can we put it back? Well they said no","~~the closest thing i can think of to this question is the first one.~~ the answer to your question has nothing to do with the popis. The *popes* were the elite of the nobility and kings of europa. They were a part of a ruling elite that was the main driver of society. It is possible that they had a strong alliance with other elites, but the only one i know of that i could think about is that of henry viii, who was a popid and had long been the leader of england's elite. I'm not sure if you're aware of this connection, and it's possible it was not directly related to the relationship between the english and the anglo-saxons. Edit: i accidentally left out the title of king of france. There are other sources, such as charles vii's *the empire of charlemagne* or the work of john s. Clark's ""the rise and fall of christianity"" which are worth reading. As for the other two, it would be an interesting read. In the meantime, i'd recommend reading the book *christian kings and knights: a biography of rome and christendom* by peter wade. F. Mackett. (2011) which is also a great introduction to pop culture in general. For a more in depth look at the ""roman history of pop history and politics and culture of politics."" it.

"[20th Century Russia] I'm about done with my first read of ""War and Peace"", and I'm curious how the book was regarded by the Soviets.","There was a Soviet era movie adaptation of the novel, but perhaps you are familiar with this. The movie itself took five years to film and has a supporting cast of thousands in the battle scenes. Many sets, extraordinary period dresses - it might be hard to measure the overall cost of the film, but it's clear it must have had the extraordinary support of the government. Religion does play a role in the film; I was expecting some kitch Soviet propaganda, but I did not pick up on it (I only understand a little Russian, so am dependent on the subtitles). I'm not sure if the project would have been supported by earlier Soviet governments. Thanks for the recommendation on Briggs, I have yet to start the novel; looking forward to more authoritative answers to this question.","During the Soviet era, ""War and Peace"" (also translated as ""War and Peace: A Novel in Five Parts"") was a highly acclaimed and influential work. The novel was written by Leo Tolstoy in the 1860s and 1870s, but it wasn't published until 1904. It was initially banned by the Russian government due to its perceived critique of the Russian imperial system and the nobility.

However, after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the book became a national treasure and a cornerstone of Soviet literature. The Soviet Union officially recognized ""War and Peace"" as a literary masterpiece and a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage.

The Soviet government and the literary establishment viewed Tolstoy's work as a way to promote socialist values and ideals. The novel was seen as a critique of the excesses of the Russian aristocracy and the corruption of the imperial system. Tolstoy's portrayal of the Russian nobility and their involvement in the Napoleonic Wars was particularly seen as a way to highlight the social and economic injustices of the time.

The novel was also used as a tool for propaganda and education. It was translated into many languages, including English, and was widely taught in schools and universities. The book was seen as a way to promote national unity, patriotism, and socialist values.

However, it's worth noting that the Soviet government also saw ""War and Peace"" as a way to promote ideological conformity. The novel was seen as a reflection of the values and norms of the Soviet state, and those who did not conform to these values were seen as a threat to the regime.

Overall, ""War and Peace"" was regarded by the Soviets as a masterpiece of Soviet literature, a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage, and a symbol of the values and ideals of the Soviet state.<|eot_id|>","It was a huge hit, especially in the first half of the 20th century. The Soviet Union was still a relatively new entity at that time, and it was very popular among the Soviet people.

The plan was to force germany to surrender on the part of russia, and to accept the terms of surrender.: the plan for a armistile treaty was a very effective way of getting the soviets to agree to the plan, as it would have given them a better understanding of how to deal with the situation, especially with regard to russia. It was an important part in establishing the peace treaty with russia that ended the war, so that the russians would not have to wait for their next war with them. It was also a great help to establish the agreement with france. : the 'plan of a defence agreement' was quite a good deal for russia and for germany, because it gave them some clarity about the nature of their role in the conflict, but also gave the germans a bit more understanding about how they would deal in a conflict between germany and russia in general. The 'plan' for war was probably the best way to get the ussr to allow the soviet union to take over the east, since it could not be put into practice if the west refused to give up its position. A few weeks later the us sent a message to germany that they were ready to make peace. A few days later, on 1 may, a letter from the president of germany read, in part, ""the following: 'we have been told that this is not a plan for peace, that it is only a form of blackmail, of war and war-mongering, for which the people of that country are responsible, if they will not accept it, then that is all. That is why we are prepared to send our troops to support the struggle, to secure the victory of our cause, which is our war'. This letter was sent on 21 may by us secretary of state john kerry to secretary john negroponte. He read the letter as follows:. . . On 27 may the united states sent its first message of its own to our allies, stating that we will do everything possible to provide for your peace in case of any attack on our territory. We have a lot of people in this country, many of them who have suffered under the occupation, who are fighting in front of you, they are not afraid to be heard and they have no fear of being attacked, we have all been assured that by our military strength, the russian army is capable of taking over your territory and that you are ready for that. As you know, our main objective is to protect the country and its people, not to kill or be killed. This is what our army and navy have always been for, this was our aim. I am certain that our people are able to cope with this and we do not want to do it again. But it must be remembered that in 1914, it took about ten days for us to prepare this document. On 14 may it had been sent to a number of important european countries, including belgium, france, germany; and it went to austria, poland, slovakia, czech republic, greece, russia; the uk, belgium and the netherlands, where it contained the main parts of this plan. In the meantime, there were some changes in our attitude, some of it less favorable, such as that of france in 1917, when we had to go to vienna, austria; but in 1920 we decided to put on hold the whole of 1918, even the first phase of 1919. And we did it at a time when the military situation was extremely difficult, with most of us being in advanced stages of struggle. Our plans were to bring about a war between us and germany on two fronts, one in europe, part and parcel of which was the balkans, i think, or the black sea, after which we would fight for them in all parts. If we could make it through the third phase, probably by 1917 and 1918 we might have won a decisive victory. So, at that time, you can say that there was no intention of giving up the fight, no idea of trying to achieve victory in 1918. What we were doing was, first of all, attacking the enemy, fighting the british and french, using the means of resistance, giving them the opportunity to develop their weapons, making them more effective. There was nothing that could have done this, only to prolong the fighting, shorten the duration of fighting and make us more able in future to defeat the enemies. Then, finally, by 1914 we reached a stage when, contrary to what we wanted, german forces could use the weapons of an anti-aircraft gunship. Therefore, everything was done in such a way as to ensure that, according to this theory, all the efforts of german troops were","Ian kershaw wrote a book called *the soviet revolution: the rise and fall of the western russian empire* in *soviet rome: a new history* (1956). It's a very interesting read. It doesn't take you to the core of what the russians were doing. The main thing i think is that the authors (i think kiersz) were looking for the most important aspects of rus' past. So, while i wouldn't say that their book is ""the most relevant"" in that it covers a large part of their history, it is an important read for those interested in the ussr's history. Edit: there are a couple of other books that cover the same subject. I've listed some of them in this thread. _url_0_ _ _page_1_ and _thread_2_ for a good discussion of that and a discussion about the historiography of those books. Hope this helps!

Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"How do you sell perfume in a down-to-earth way? ""Buy our perfume! It's better than our competitor because....it smells good!""  The sole purpose of perfume ad is to create brand awareness instead of being informative like drug ads (our allergy pills are more effective) or car ads (our cars are much safer than their car). Perfume formula don't change from year to year, so they can't say why it's better than the previous year's model. Perfume preference is extremely subjective, so it's hard to say your perfume smells better and explain why. We all know what perfumes do, you can't even do an ad base on that. Their ads are really just there to tell you they exist. You can't visually see the product being used, so they are usually trying to show either an idealized consumer of their product (use our perfume and you can be like her!) or the imaginary effect of their products (use our perfume and get laid!). When you try to convey an abstract idea, it's best to act it out rather than describe it with words.","Advertisements for colognes and perfumes often feature unusual and sometimes bizarre imagery. Here are some possible reasons why:

1. **Historical roots**: The perfume and cologne industries have a long history of using unconventional marketing techniques. In the past, perfume advertisements often featured elaborate sets, elaborate characters, and even puppeteers to convey the fragrance's personality.
2. **Attention-grabbing**: Perfume and cologne advertisements are meant to grab the viewer's attention, which is why they often feature eye-catching imagery, such as colorful characters, elaborate sets, or even 3D models.
3. **Emotional connection**: Perfume and cologne advertisements are designed to evoke emotions, such as romance, sophistication, or relaxation. By using unusual imagery, the ads create an emotional connection with the viewer.
4. **High-end luxury**: Perfumes and colognes are often associated with high-end luxury and exclusivity. The use of unusual imagery may be intended to convey that the product is rare, exclusive, or of exceptional quality.
5. **Marketing strategy**: Advertisements for perfumes and colognes often use a combination of psychological and behavioral techniques to influence the viewer's purchasing decisions. Unusual imagery may be used to create a sense of intrigue, curiosity, or even fear (e.g., the ""fear of not smelling your perfume"").
6. **Brand identity**: Perfumes and colognes often have unique brand identities that are reflected in their advertising. Unusual imagery may be used to convey the brand's personality, values, or values.

Some examples of unusual advertisements for perfumes and colognes include:

* Old Spice's ""The Man Your Wife Wants"" campaign, which features a series of bizarre and humorous ads featuring men in various situations.
* Dior's ""The Legend of Gucci"" campaign, which features a series of surreal and fantastical ads showcasing the luxury brand's products.
* Tom Ford's ""The Art of Seduction"" campaign, which features a series of provocative and seductive ads showcasing the luxury brand's products.

Keep in mind that these ads are meant to be attention-grabbing and engaging, rather than genuinely effective or honest.<|eot_id|>","I have a theory. Perfumes are expensive, and you are going to want to buy a lot of them. So you want to buy the most expensive one. That's why you see them in a lot of ads. You want to buy a lot of them, so you want to show them off.  Also, perfumes are very strong, so you want to be able to smell them from a distance. So you want to show them off from a distance.  I think the other reason is that perfume ads are often very expensive to make. You want to show off how expensive they are, so you want to put them in an expensive setting.  I don't know the full story, but I think these are the main reasons.<|eot_id|>","The idea that the product will make you want to use it and not try it is a very common one. The same goes for the idea of the perfume. Why is this strange, and why is it so important to me?i don't know. I don, for example, have a fetish for perfume, or a taste for perfumed foods. But i do have some fond memories of these things. The first time i went to a perfume store, i was in the middle of my shift and my girlfriend asked me to order some perfume in advance of work. When i ordered the scent, she asked if i would like to buy it. ""if you like it, you can buy me some. You can also buy the fragrance yourself."" i said, ""i'll buy a lot of perfume for you."" so she gave me the order, got me a little bit of a bottle of it when i came home, gave it to her, then she brought it home and gave the bottle to the manager, who then took it back to my house. So i didn't have to take the smell of perfumery and perfume to work, which is why i am not a regular perfume buyer. This is what i like about the brand. The smell is very fresh and it's very natural. It's like a really, really good perfume (i'm talking about ""cigarot""). Is it a big perfume company? __________in a sense it isn't. They are not big, they are a small company. And so they have been doing it for a long time. Like most perfume companies, there are two main brands. One is cologna (the brand name for it), and one is naturals. Numerals are the same as perfums, but they offer a different kind of fragrance. You can see that n&o is the one that is going to sell the most fragrances. If they sell a few more, n and o will be the next big ones. At least, that's what the c&n brand says. A few years ago, the company announced that it would be making a new fragrance called cascadian. Now, it has announced an update to its brand names. Coconut is called nautilus, cacao is named m&m, violets is renamed sperms, s&w is name of its own. There are other names, like giorgio armani. In my opinion, this is one of those things that i really like. To me, these are just some of their products. As far as i know, all of them have one thing in common.","~~there are a couple of reasons. 1) the cologne industry has a lot of money, so the ads are more like the kind you see on the cover of a magazine. 2) there are regulations on how you can advertise in the usa, and some countries have laws against selling alcohol in public. 3) some of the commercials are aimed at teenagers, which is a huge demographic. The whole point of cokes is that they're a product that's been around for a long time and has been pretty popular in europe. If you're trying to sell an ad on a tv show, you have to pay a very specific amount to make sure it's not being used for commercial purposes. This is not unheard of. There's even a law that forbids advertising on tv shows that are set in places that you don't want children to be exposed to. But that isn't all. And it isn’t limited to america. Other countries are doing the same thing. Edit: added some more info on alcohol. [here's](_url_0_) a few more sources. Tl;dr: the alcohol industry is huge and big. Many americans are really into it, because of their love of it. So many companies make it popular. Most american teens are into cuddly cudgels. Cuz they also like cuds. It and have it because it is popular and because they have a big market. For their parents. They like it so much they sell it very often. In americas are big, but also have huge. Or because americana is cheap. Also, they want to do it with the kids. Americano and americon and beer and pepsi. We like to get it too. All of them. People like being big and drink it more. I think italy and other things that aren‘s cuddled. Some americania too, cuddle. Want it all the other cnn and a little cinks, italian c. Sau, nada and nfl and cicos. L. C. D. M.

And you may not even know it: this is the place to find your best friend. When i was a kid, i went to the local grocery store. They were all ""free-for-all"" and there was no problem, no one was asking for a discount. I knew i would get a free cart for $2.50. In fact, they had the best prices. My parents were so happy to see me get free. So i asked my mom if i could buy a cart, and she said, ""yes, we can!"" and i've never seen anyone buy an extra cart without asking. It was so nice to know they were looking for something that was free, something to be used, for free and then they said ""we'll give you a coupon."" it wasn't too hard. This was the first time i'd ever been to a store that had free deals. There was an older woman there who was my best friends. She had a little kid who didn't even have a car. And she was in an expensive car and my friend was just looking at a picture of her car on the internet. But then she asked if we could give her a gift. ""sure, what's that?"" she told me. Then she looked at me and said she wanted a second car, so i had to take her and her friend to this place. The price was $5.00, which is just over $200. At first i thought it was cheap, but then i realized that i didn, in fact had some other car to give to my friends, because they wanted to get some for me to use. Not that they gave me anything. We were both really happy with the car we got. Later, my parents asked me if it would be a good idea to drive the kid to school, to buy groceries, etc. And i said yes. That's what i did. After the whole experience, it's easy to understand why i chose this store because it has so many great deals, some of which are free for you to purchase. Some of the deals are a bit of a hassle to navigate, like the price of ""jumbo basket"" which i purchased for about $1.99. For free shipping, you will have to pay the shipping and handling fees. If you don't have one, please take a look at my shop at the top of this page. Also, here is a great deal on ""rabbit"" so you can get one for the same price as your first order. You may find that it is very expensive, especially if you buy the ""bowl"" at your local store, not the other way around. A good way to think about it, is that if a person buys a package of $10 or less, then it will cost them $25. However, if they buy it for less than $20, or if the package is for more than that, that's a $50 discount, right? If they bought it at $30, plus shipping or handling, the cost will be $0.30. Therefore, when i buy something, usually the cheaper it gets, this will always be the one to choose. Remember, though, there are many free products out there. These are the ones that are available for just $15, a lot of them, even for people who don...","Ianl ronald reagan's ""the man"" is getting a lot of hate for his book, the ""true story of the ussr"" by michael kosnoff. He writes about how the soviet union was a communist dictatorship, and how he was one of a few that managed to keep up with the rest of eastern europe. I'm really excited to see what the next book will be about. For me, it's going to be a bit of an obsession. It seems like it has been a while since i've read it, but i love it.

Do lie detectors work?,"they never did and never will, these who measure electric resistance or heart rate. these have been invented by insane people and promoted by scammers. if however you include some sort of high resolution fmri, thats another story, but far from being a mobile or practical version.","Lie detectors, also known as polygraph tests or truth-in-adjudication tests, are devices used to measure physiological responses, such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as behavioral responses, like brain waves, when a person is under stress or deception.

While lie detectors have been used in various contexts, including law enforcement, they do not work as a foolproof method to detect deception. Here's why:

1. **Limited accuracy**: Lie detectors are not 100% accurate. They can detect deception, but not everyone who is lying will respond to the test. This is known as the ""false positive rate.""
2. **Context-dependent**: Lie detectors measure physiological responses, but they do not capture the full context of a person's behavior. For example, a person may be lying about their financial situation, but also about their relationship or health.
3. **Variability**: Physiological responses can vary greatly from person to person, even when they are under stress or deception. This means that a lie detector may not detect deception in someone who is not trying to deceive.
4. **No foolproof method**: Lie detectors are not a reliable way to detect deception. In fact, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that lie detectors are not an effective method for detecting deception.

In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled that polygraph tests are not a reliable method for detecting deception. The court found that lie detectors are not reliable because they can be influenced by various factors, such as:

- **Reactivity**: A person's physiological responses can be influenced by their emotional state, which can affect the accuracy of the test.
- **Context**: The test is only as accurate as the context in which it is administered.
- **Psychological factors**: A person's past experiences, personality traits, and cognitive biases can affect their test results.

In summary, while lie detectors can detect some aspects of deception, they are not a reliable method for detecting deception. Other factors, such as psychological and contextual influences, can affect the accuracy of the test.<|eot_id|>","The lie detector works by measuring changes in your heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological responses to stress. It's been shown to be fairly accurate, but it's not perfect. It's also been shown to be unreliable in certain situations, such as when you're lying about something that is not relevant to the test. If you're lying about something that is relevant, it's possible that your lie detector will show you as telling the truth, but this is not necessarily the case.  It's also worth noting that the lie detector is not a reliable method of determining whether someone is lying. It's not a reliable method of determining whether someone is telling the truth, and it's not a reliable method of determining whether someone is lying about something that is not relevant to the test.<|eot_id|>","**********answer: i have a question about the lack of a lie detector. If you answer the question correctly, you will be able to pass the lie test. (please keep in mind that we do not recommend lying detectors to test for knowledge of language. We simply want to know if we can successfully pass a test.): (question) (answer)""well, there is a lot of evidence that you can tell when you lie. So how can you prove it?""—lying. ""what is the problem?"" answer: if your question is not answered correctly in the first place, then you are lying. I know you say that there are two ways to answer a ""problem"". The first is to simply tell your answer, and then the second is either to say you were lying or to make a joke about it. The answer to the last question has to be the same as the one to which you responded. It is always better to tell the answer if you have not been lying, than if the other way is true. You can also tell by telling your reply that it is correct. (i would suggest that the latter is your best bet, but i do not recommend it.) you should be careful to not say something that may be taken out of context. When you tell a story about a person's past, or about their future, it may not be true, because it would mean that their present is different. That is, if your story is about someone's family, their friends, etc., you may well be lying to them. Also, lie in order to gain information from them, to gather information that they may have forgotten. These are the rules of the game. Remember, that your lie is very important. And the more you use it, the better it will look.","Ian kershaw has a great book on lie detector. Basically they are basically just a bunch of smart people who have a very hard time getting a good lie to work. There are a few different types of lie detection, and the most common one is the [lie detector test](_url_0_). It's very accurate, but it isn't perfect, or even that accurate. It is not very good at getting the truth out, because it doesn't do a lot of good. You can also test the reliability of a lie if you are going to lie. I personally don't like lying, so i don’t really like the test, even though it does work well for me. So, you should be able to get the same results without the tests. But, if the results are so terrible, then you might not want to use the lie machine. If it works, it might be worth checking out. The best way to test for lie is to just see if your lie was wrong, not to say if there is a scientific reason for it. Even if that is true, i would not recommend trying to convince a person to admit it, as it can be difficult and difficult to prove otherwise. And can cause serious harm to the person. Also, the machine is designed to make you more honest, which is why you would trust it over the machines. Edit: i have not tested it though, also tested this in my own life.

Why do things only burn in high atmosphere?,"They don't travel at the same speed when they are lower. For things coming in: The atmosphere slowed them down so much that they don't produce much heat any more when they enter the lower atmosphere. For things we shoot out: Rockets start slow, they only get really fast once they are in the upper atmosphere.","In the atmosphere, including the high atmosphere, combustion and fires are relatively rare. This is due to several factors:

1. **Low oxygen levels**: The high atmosphere has very little oxygen (less than 10%) compared to the Earth's surface. Combustion reactions require oxygen to sustain them.
2. **High temperatures**: The high atmosphere is extremely hot, with temperatures ranging from -89°C to 120°C (−130°F to 248°F). This makes combustion reactions difficult to initiate and sustain.
3. **Low pressure**: The high atmosphere has very low pressure, which makes it challenging for gases to mix and react.
4. **Chemical inertness**: Many substances in the high atmosphere are chemically inert, meaning they don't readily react with other substances.

However, there are some exceptions:

1. **Fog and cloud formation**: These are actually the result of combustion, where fuel is burned to produce heat and light, which then cools the air and creates fog or clouds.
2. **Volcanic activity**: Volcanoes can produce fires and combustion in the high atmosphere, especially when gases are released into the atmosphere.
3. **Auroral activity**: The high atmosphere can also produce spectacular light displays, known as the aurora, which are caused by the interaction of charged particles from the solar wind.

In summary, the high atmosphere is a challenging environment for combustion and fires to occur due to its low oxygen levels, high temperatures, low pressure, and chemical inertness.<|eot_id|>",The main reason is that the air in the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. The nitrogen and oxygen are very stable molecules and they do not react with each other easily. The nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere are also the main components of the atmosphere. The reason they are the main components is because they are the stable molecules. The air in the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen because they are the stable molecules. The nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere are also the main components of the atmosphere because they are the stable molecules.  The other reason is that the temperature of the atmosphere is relatively low. The temperature of the atmosphere is also relatively low. The nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere are also the main components of the atmosphere because they are the stable molecules. The nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere are also the main components of the atmosphere because they are the stable molecules. The temperature of the atmosphere is also relatively low. The nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere are also the main components of the atmosphere because they are the stable molecules.<|eot_id|>,"The reason i'm using this term is that it's more accurate than the term ""light pollution"". I will explain below why. I am not the first person to find this to be true. I think it is a useful comparison of the two. For example, i found the following graph, which shows that the sun is constantly in the upper right hand corner of this graph. This is because the average of temperature is equal to the solar radiation. (this graph shows the same thing as the graph above, with the sun's temperature in a lower right corner, but with a higher solar irradiance.)in the case of solar power, the higher the temperature, more co2 is released from the atmosphere, and the more energy is being released into the environment. In the situation of light pollution, this is an important distinction. On average, about half the co 2 from sunlight is emitted into our atmosphere each year. So, it can be seen that, on average in an atmosphere that is not too warm, co can reach about 100 times the amount of co dioxide in our climate. That is, if the intensity of sunlight in your atmosphere is more than 1,000 times that of that in sunlight, you can see that a 1-m2-th of a degree of climate change would result in more greenhouse gases being emitted. When this occurs, that 1/2 degree would mean that you could see 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide being burned every year, or about one million tons each of plants and animals being killed each day. If you are an urban dweller, for example. You would see more of these 1 million-ton tons. It is true that this 1 billion-tens of tons would cause the oceans to become more acidic, thus producing more carbon. But this would not be the whole story. The ocean is also more sensitive to temperature changes. As the ocean becomes warmer, so does the planet's surface. And as you move up the heat, as it cools, your water vapor is able to evaporate. These changes in water temperature can make the surface of your planet more vulnerable to heat and more susceptible to cooling. However, since the earth is surrounded by water, some of it will get colder as well. Since the water is so dense, its molecules can't absorb the extra heat. Therefore, even though the climate of an earth-like planet is warmer than that on the moon, most of our planet would be colder than this. We are also at the extreme end of some extreme temperatures. At the high end, there is much less co₂ that can get through the air. To put this in perspective, imagine a world where the world is on a flat surface, not covered by the sea. You would have a very small amount that could get out of there. Of course, a small part of you gets into that. Now imagine that there are a million people living on this flat planet. They are all in different stages of their lives. Your life span would get shorter if you were to live on one flat world. After all, what is the point of life if people lived on two flat worlds? Why are you living in two worlds if it would take a billion years to die on that flat earth? So you don't get the benefit of all of those benefits, in fact, at all. Instead, life on flat planets is just a tiny fraction of what you get when you live in one. Just the opposite. Life on earth was very different from living under the moon. Even though we live under a moon, we are living at a different time in space. There is no moon in orbit around the earth, although there were moons in mars. Also, mars is very cold and rocky. People from mars are more likely to develop cancers. Furthermore, scientists say that mars will have more volcanoes. One of them is called mount sharp. Some people believe that mount fuji is volcanic. No, mount mount shasta is actually a volcano. Because mount shimasta has a high elevation, volcanic activity can cause more lava to erupt on mount shu. What does this all mean? Well, according to some, mt. Fuji was the site of one of earth's most famous volcanos, named mount pinatubo. Well known for its volcanic eruptions, pinata is one such volcano on mt fuji. Pinati is located in central chile, along the border between the u. S. And chile. Mount panay is close to mount paolo. According to a recent study, ""in 2009, two volcanism experts from chile and argentina published a paper about the volcano and how it could be connected with mt pinato."" the same paper is available here . Pina is named after a local mountain in pinay, called pinara. Apparently, during the 1950s and 1960s in chile many people from pinaya were living there, living with their families and working in mining, agriculture and other industries","~~it's not that the stuff that burns is only in low atmosphere.~~ it's that it has a high specific heat, and therefore is hot enough to burn. The actual chemical reaction that causes the heat is more complicated than that, but the basic principle is that when something is in a very high temperature, it can't burn, so it burns much hotter. This is why in the presence of a lot of oxygen, you can make the fire much much, much more hot. You just need to have more oxygen than the air around it, which is what's going to get the flame. _____________________________ i hope this helps. Edit: i'm using a more general term, ""burning in hot temperatures."" in this case, burning in air is just a way to heat something up, to the point where it needs to be hot to sustain the chemical reactions required. There are other factors that can be involved, like the amount of co2 present in atmosphere, the temperature of the atmosphere at the time, etc. But i think this will explain the basics.

How were Genghis Khan and the Mongols perceived in Chinese historiography?,I can't answer your question specifically but have you checked out the podcast Hardcore History by Dan Carlin? He's wrapping up a multi part on the Mongols. It's really well done and he goes into your question.,"In Chinese historiography, the Mongols were initially perceived as a ""barbarian"" empire, a term used to describe non-Han Chinese groups that were perceived as foreign, weak, and inferior. This perception was rooted in the Chinese perception of the Mongols as a nomadic people who were not fully part of the Han Chinese society.

However, over time, the Mongols were also perceived as a ""universal"" empire, a term used to describe a vast and inclusive empire that encompassed all of China, including the Han Chinese. This perception was reflected in the Chinese historiography of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), where the Mongols were depicted as a unifying force that brought together different regions and ethnic groups.

In the 13th century, during the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols were also referred to as a ""pax Mongolica,"" or ""Mongol peace,"" which reflected their role as a mediator between the Han Chinese and other non-Han Chinese groups in China.

It wasn't until the 18th century, during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), that the Mongols were fully incorporated into Chinese historiography. The Qing rulers sought to legitimize their rule by promoting the Mongols as a legitimate ruler of all of China, rather than just the Han Chinese.

The Qing rulers also sought to promote the Mongols as a symbol of unity and cooperation, reflecting the Mongols' role as a unifying force in Chinese history. This led to a more positive perception of the Mongols in Chinese historiography, where they were depicted as a wise and just ruler who brought together different regions and ethnic groups.

Overall, the Chinese perception of the Mongols has evolved over time, from a negative perception as a ""barbarian"" empire to a more positive perception as a ""universal"" empire and eventually a ""pax Mongolica"" empire.<|eot_id|>","The Chinese view of the Mongols is a little complicated, but the short answer is that they are not really viewed as a ""civilization"" in the same way as the Chinese did. The Mongols were seen as a ""barbarian"" force, and were often referred to as ""barbarians"" (, gāng). The Chinese were wary of the Mongols, but they were not particularly afraid of them. The Mongols were not the same as the ""barbarians"" of the previous era, but they were not the same as the ""barbarians"" of the next era. They were a ""barbarian"" force, but they were not the same as the ""barbarians"" of the previous era, and they were not the same as the ""barbarians"" of the next era.<|eot_id|>","ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ(chinese: the people of the past were seen as an enemy. ㅠㄠ 김 오으는 타리를 어고 아장).-(noun: a person who is seen by the eye as a part of an elite group.㌽) (chuan: gengha) (nominative) a man who has achieved great status or power in the country.

He gives a good overview of the history of china, and talks a little bit about the chivalric practices of mao, but i don't think you'll find much in the way of historical sources. I think your question is more about how chivalry was perceived by the elites than how it was viewed in modern chu dynasty chiang kai-shek. The emperor himself was regarded as the father figure of modern western chan, with his family having a relatively high position in power. While i can't say for sure whether the ming dynasty was very strict on how they viewed miao ching, i do know that muo zedong was not the first to do so. For example, he was the last emperor of jin dynasty, the dynasty that ended with the death of zing zuo, who was seen as a very cruel ruler and was executed by a single emperor.

"With clothes that are years old, when they go through the dryer...there is always a huge amount of lint in the dryer trap. Where does the lint keep coming from since the clothes / towels don't ""seem"" to be disintegrating?","They're disintegrating. It's kinda unusual for old, heavily washed fabrics to build up a ton of lint though. Usually you get major lint shedding the first few washes and then increasingly less as the fabric ages. You may notice that your towels are getting increasingly coarse as they age. They don't *look* different to an untrained eye, but they are slowly falling apart with each wash cycle.","The perpetual problem of lint accumulation in dryers. It's a common issue, and there are several reasons why lint keeps coming back, despite the clothes not seeming to disintegrate. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Lint is not actually lint**: While it's true that the lint is a byproduct of the drying process, it's not actually lint. In fact, lint is the soft, fluffy fibers that are shed from clothing, towels, and other fabrics. These fibers can be quite fine and can easily become airborne.
2. **Drying cycle**: The dryer's drying cycle can sometimes cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly cleaned or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.
3. **Lint trap design**: The design of the lint trap can also contribute to lint accumulation. If the trap is not designed to catch lint, it can accumulate in the dryer and cause problems.
4. **Drying cycle duration**: If the dryer is running for too long, it can cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly loaded or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.
5. **Lint trap maintenance**: Regular maintenance of the lint trap is essential to prevent lint accumulation. This includes cleaning the lint trap regularly and replacing it if necessary.

To minimize lint accumulation, you can try the following:

* Regularly clean the lint trap and dryer vent.
* Load the dryer correctly, with clothes and towels evenly distributed.
* Run the dryer for a shorter duration than usual.
* Use a lint trap with a built-in lint trap or a lint trap with a longer lint trap to catch more lint.
* Consider using a lint roller or a lint-free drying rack to reduce lint accumulation.

Remember, while the clothes may not seem to disintegrate, the lint is still a byproduct of the drying process and can accumulate in the dryer trap.<|eot_id|>","Mostly it's from the clothes that are washed and then dried.  The lint is just the small fibers that are left in the wash water. They're not really broken down into a usable form. They're just like a bunch of tiny hairs that are floating in the water.  The fibers in the clothes are broken down by the wash water, and the lint is left behind.  The lint is the same stuff that comes out of the washing machine, but it's just a bunch of tiny fibers that have been left behind.<|eot_id|>","The clothes can stay dry for a while, but there is a great deal of time and energy involved. In this case, the laundry detergent will keep the soap from dripping in all the way down. My answer to this question is to say that, if the detergents are not working, there's no way to make them work. You can simply make a small amount and run it through a clean dryant. How to make a clean dryant1. Clean the detergentas mentioned, you will need to clean the dryer.2. In a large pot, add the laundry detergent. This is very important. 3. Once the liquid is dissolved, mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Mix the wet and dry ingredients in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the top of the washcloth and rinse the cloth. The dry cleaner will start to smell like a detergie. When the water is done, rinse with cold water and let sit for 5-10 minutes. If the washed clothes are still wet, then rinse them with a little cold wash. You can use a cloth towel to wipe off the stains. I use the old towel that i bought for my washing machine, i don. The one that is still clean. Also, use some paper towels to pat the bottom of your towel. They will stick to the towel and not on the fabric. 3. Place the towel back into the washing pot. 4. Remove the washcloth. 5. Apply a heavy, wet cloth over it. 6. Put the cloth towels back in and lay them out on a towel rack. 7. Leave the clearant to dry. 8. Use a wet towel or a damp cloth to rinse. 9. To make the clean drying towell, place a dry cloth on top and place the wipe toward tow. 10. Let it dry in about 5 minutes, and then wash the wettest clothes. 11. Set the cleanser on. 12. After 5 mins, wash again and put the towels back on and wait for the cleaning to finish. 13. Now, try to get rid of all of these clothes and the stain. 14. Turn off all lights, turn off any lights that you dont like, remove the light fixture that your laundry is using, clean and wipe the clean cloth off. 15. Finish with the clearant and wash your clothes, just like before. 16. Keep in mind that this is not the same as washing a wash cloth, this can be done with any detergenic soap. 17. Do not use any soap with soap residue. 18. Just wipe away all residue and try again. 19. As you go into washing, do not let the residue on your washcloths, they are the ones that have to stay clean, don't do that. 20. Using a different detergen will make your detergs even more toxic, so be sure to use an alcohol-based detergelator. 21. It is best to wash clothes using the bleach, since it can get the mess from the cleaners. 22. For more information about how to do this, check out the information i provided on this blog. 23. Remember, once the clothing has been thoroughly cleaned, it will smell much better and be easier to remove. 24. Take a look at the pictures below. 25. Here is the original picture, that we used for this post, in its original state. 26. Notice the difference in color between the white and black clothes? 27. What does that mean? 28. And how does this affect the color of my laundry? 29. How does it affect my cleaning? 30. Can you tell me about the odor? 31. Okay, now i know what the smell is like. 32. So, how is it different from what i have seen before? 33. Is it the scent or the temperature? 34. Why is that? 35. Where are my clothes stored? 36. Are there any other clothes i would like to put back? 37. There are also many other questions that can also be answered here.","Ive seen a couple of threads on this, and a few more here, so i'll just link to one of them. _url_0_ _link_1_ edit: there's also a thread on it, but it's from a year ago, which should answer your question. But the answer is, it keeps coming. Lids are a big part of the fabric, even in new clothes. The only time i've ever seen fabric that is lid-less, was a new pair of jeans, for example. It was the first time in my life i saw fabric lidded. And it looks like it kept coming because it didn't go into a full lather. Not sure if it actually does, though.

What is speaking in tongues?,"Speaking in tongues is a term used to describe a person trying to speak a language they don't understand. It may sound like that language to the uneducated because it uses known sounds and verbages but is in reality nothing but gibberish. I apologize for possibly sounding racist here but it's like saying ""Ching chong chang"" and claiming you speak Chinese. More commonly it also refers to a technique used by religious preachers to babble language that is said to be divine language or God speaking through them. Using the technique to claim that it is part of the religious experience. Research into the phenomenon however has shown that it in fact has hypnotic properties and is basically used to brainwash people. Hearing the babble under specific context creates a trance like state of mind in which people are open to suggestion.","Speaking in tongues, also known as glossolalia, is a practice in some Christian denominations, particularly in Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. It is characterized by speaking in a language that is not understood by others, often in a spontaneous and unscripted manner.

In speaking in tongues, individuals believe that they are receiving the Holy Spirit, which enables them to communicate in a language that is not their native language. This practice is often associated with the apostolic faith, where believers believe that they are receiving the Spirit's power to speak in tongues.

The practice of speaking in tongues is rooted in the biblical account of the apostolic faith (Acts 2:14-20, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11). According to the New Testament, the apostles were able to speak in tongues because they were filled with the Holy Spirit. In speaking in tongues, believers are believed to be receiving a form of communication that transcends the limitations of human language.

While speaking in tongues is a central aspect of some Christian denominations, it is not universally accepted. Many Christian denominations, including the majority of Protestant and Catholic churches, do not believe in the literal occurrence of speaking in tongues. Instead, they view it as a symbolic expression of the believer's spiritual experience.

Some common misconceptions about speaking in tongues include:

*   It is a sign of being possessed by the devil or a demon.
*   It is a sign of being unspiritual or unsanctified.
*   It is a sign of being in a state of emotional or mental turmoil.

In reality, speaking in tongues is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been studied extensively in various fields, including psychology, sociology, and theology. While it is not universally accepted, speaking in tongues remains a significant aspect of some Christian denominations and continues to be a topic of ongoing debate and discussion.<|eot_id|>","It's the belief that when you pray, you are communicating with God in a language that we cannot understand. This is not a scientifically supported belief, but it's a belief that many people have. It's not necessarily a belief that they're hearing a voice in their head. It's just a belief that they're communicating with God. Some people also believe that speaking in tongues is a way of expressing a deeper, more spiritual feeling.

I had been studying english in college for a while and i started learning the language in english class. The first question i got was, ""how do you pronounce a word?"" and it was a good question, because i knew what i was talking about. But i didn't know how to pronounce it. So i wrote down what was called a pronunciative word, and then i looked at my dictionary and found a list of pronouncing words, which was the best i could find. So i decided to do a little research, but i wasn't sure what to expect. In fact, i thought i'd be surprised if i ever did. I actually was expecting to see some of the pronunciation sounds that people had to give me. Well, they were quite different. Some of them were more verbose, some more masculine, or some were just a bit more formal. It was very easy to read. And i found that there were some very good pronailing sounds, like ""he,"" ""she,"" and ""it.""but in fact i only had one word that was pronounced correctly: ""it."" and when i asked, it just said ""he."" it wasnwell, that's pretty impressive. Now i'm just going to tell you something, though. When i first started studying the pronunciation of words and the sounds of different pronutations, there was an awful lot of confusion, especially in my class, where i would have to use both ""you"" and other pronutation words. That's a real problem. You get confused when you don't get what you want. Like i said, you just have a few things to say that you can't say. For example, in french, the word ""le mouvre"" means ""that's not what it is."" in english, when ""let it go"" is pronounced, this is a ""i"" or ""y"" sound. There was one instance where we had a lot more confusion when we said that ""if you do that, then it's fine."" so you have something to add to that. Of course, we're in a situation where it would be more accurate to make a sentence like,if you are going out, get out. If you're going in, let it come. ""if it comes, please come."" that was sort of a classic french thing. Because i remember that i used to have one sentence that said something like that and another one that just kept saying that until it came. We were like the second generation. One day, a girl came up to me and said to my mother, hey, come, are you ok? And she said she was okay, she had just been walking around the house. She said it had something in it for her. What's the problem?there were many examples of that sort, of people saying things like this, saying it doesn't have anything to it, to them, people like to be in the middle of things and not know what's going on. To me, my language teacher, as you know, is the one person who can really help me get to the point where if someone is in that situation, who is going into it without knowing what the situation is, what they're doing and what their intentions are, if you understand the thing, how they feel, just knowing that that person's doing it and that it has something or what needs to happen and when that happens, can you help them understand that? So that kind of person is really a really good person. Just like i am. Maybe my teachers can help you out there.","Ive never heard of it. The only reason i can think of is it's a way of explaining things to a child that makes them feel better. For example, when you're in a room with a bunch of people talking, it would be nice if everyone was quiet, but they could talk and the kids wouldn't have to be that way. I think it might also be a learned behavior. If you talk to someone who knows you can't speak, they might be able to tell you how to speak better because it makes you feel more comfortable. It may also have something to do with our language. So we can teach ourselves to use words that we know we'll be using to convey our feelings. And when we do it, we are teaching ourselves how words are used, so that the person who learned it will be comfortable with it and can use it to communicate with us. (i'm not sure how common this is though) so there's no real reason for it not be learned. Edit: spelling. Sorry. Grammar. Thanks. [edit 2: grammar!](_url_0_) edited 3: i'm glad i didn't miss a word.

"why do some of the superhero movies keep repeating the same villains - superman/luthor, batman/joker, spiderman/oscorp?","Because those are the character's most recognizable, most easily created and most evil enemies. Sure, you can have Batman go against Mr Freeze, but you have to explain who he is. Instead you have a man dedicating his life to order go against the human embodiment of chaos. You can have Spiderman need to fight off the Rhino or Scorpion, but then you have to explain to people that these guys are villains and not furries. Instead you have relatively average human Peter Parker go up against a giant corporation and an alien parasite (venom). Superman has some cool villains, but all are too expensive to make or have too large of a backstory to show in a single movie. Hence why you do see things like Doomsday, Apocalypse and Brainiac, but usually just in the TV series or in an animated movie. Instead it's easier to have everyman Clark Kent go against billionaire Luthor.","The repetition of the same villains in superhero movies can be attributed to several reasons:

1. **Established lore**: Many superhero franchises have a rich history of characters, villains, and storylines. By reusing familiar villains, filmmakers can maintain continuity and avoid contradicting previous films.
2. **Character consistency**: Reusing villains allows filmmakers to maintain character consistency, ensuring that the same characters behave in the same way. This consistency helps to build a cohesive and engaging story.
3. **Pacing and plot**: Reusing villains can also help with pacing and plot. By not introducing new villains, filmmakers can avoid disrupting the narrative flow and maintain a consistent pace.
4. **Franchise branding**: Reusing villains can also be a way to reinforce franchise branding. By using familiar villains, filmmakers can create a sense of continuity and familiarity among fans, which can be beneficial for the franchise's overall appeal.
5. **Budget and logistics**: Reusing villains can also be more budget-friendly and logistically easier. Using familiar villains means less need for elaborate set designs, costumes, and stunts, which can save money and reduce production time.

That being said, some critics argue that reusing villains can be a missed opportunity for innovation and creativity. By not introducing new villains, filmmakers may miss the chance to explore fresh ideas and themes.

In the case of the Batman franchise, the reuse of villains like the Joker and the Riddler can be seen as a missed opportunity for innovation. The Joker, in particular, has been portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in ""Joker"" and Joaquin's portrayal of the character has been widely praised. While it's understandable that the filmmakers may have wanted to explore other interpretations of the character, the fact remains that the Joker is a iconic and complex villain who deserves more attention.

In the case of Spider-Man, the reuse of villains like the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus can be seen as a missed opportunity for innovation. The Green Goblin, in particular, has been portrayed by Willem Dafoe in multiple Spider-Man films, and while Dafoe's portrayal of the character has been widely praised, it's also been argued that the character could have been explored in greater depth.

Ultimately, the reuse of villains in superhero movies can be seen as a creative choice that prioritizes franchise branding, character consistency, and pacing over innovation and originality.<|eot_id|>","The most common reason is that there's a certain kind of audience that really enjoys the same villains. Batman, Spiderman, and Superman are all very popular, so it's not uncommon to see them in a movie. This is why you'll often see them in the same movie, or in the same movie with other characters that are also popular.  The other reason is that these movies are all really good, and you want to see them again. You're a fan, so you want to see them again. If you don't like the movie, you might not go see it again, but if you like it, you'll go see it again.  This is why you'll often see the same movies, and why they're all so popular.<|eot_id|>","There's a good reason for this. Batman (2005) and spiderman (2007) both use the name of a super villain. However, the origin of this trope is a mystery. It's usually referred to as ""supervillain"" because of their strong, super-powered personalities, and their ability to change their reality to fit their needs. This is why the supervillains are often portrayed as a way to break free of all of that. This trope has been a staple of comic books since the 1960s, with the first of these being ""the man who killed the joker"". It also seems to be a big part of some marvel movies, as it was one of my favorite superhero films of all-star weekend. I'm not sure why there's no other superhero movie that does this, but i can't help but wonder if it's because the heroes are so different.","Irl, it's the ""hero"" thing that makes it so that it doesn't seem like it has to be the exact same character. A good example is the avengers, which was set in the 90s and was never released in theaters. They have changed a lot since then. The reason it continues to exist is because of that. There are lots of different versions of avenger and avenged movies, and the fact that they're all the heroes makes them look like the one that got the most attention. It just seems to happen more and more often, because people are more likely to watch them, even if they don't know how the story is going. That's why it keeps happening, to an extent. I'm sure there's a few other reasons, but the big one is that people aren't used to the current superhero genre, so it feels like a better time to have a new one. So the best thing to do is get new versions, like when the old ones are released, or if the new ones aren’t popular. Then people just like new stories. This. You can make the super hero movies a little different, too, by making them different movies.

Why can we smell food more easily when the food is hot?,"Short answer, yes. The stuff in the food that we can smell enters the air more easily when warm.  The real answer is that aromatic compounds are more volatile at higher temperatures.","When food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds into the air. These compounds are the molecules that give us the smell of food. Here's why we can smell food more easily when it's hot:

1. **Increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs):** When food is hot, the Maillard reaction occurs, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is cooked. This reaction produces more VOCs, which are the molecules responsible for our sense of smell.
2. **Enhanced volatile emissions:** Hot food releases more VOCs into the air, making the scent of the food more intense and pronounced.
3. **Increased aldehyde release:** Aldehydes are a type of VOC that is released when food is heated. They are responsible for the characteristic ""aromatic"" or ""fatty"" smell of cooked foods.
4. **Smell of the cooking process:** When food is hot, it can also release the smell of the cooking process, such as the aroma of butter or oil. These smells can be more intense when food is hot, making the food more appetizing.

In summary, when food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds, which are responsible for our sense of smell. This is why we can smell food more easily when it's hot, and why cooking food can be such a sensory experience.<|eot_id|>","Smelling food is more of a sensation than a smell, it's just your nose detecting molecules. When you smell something, it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules. When the molecules are hot, they are moving around more quickly, so your nose can detect them more easily.  The hot food is also more volatile, so it's more likely that it will be able to escape your nose and into your lungs. This is why you can smell food even if it's cold, but you can't smell it if it's frozen.<|eot_id|>","We do not smell the same as when we are in the heat. [youtube http://www. Youtube. Com/watch?v=xj6p2k-kp4&feature=youtu. Be]the question is: what is a heat lamp?i am not a fan of heat lamps, but i have found a couple that work well and are easy to use. What do you use for the light? Well, i use a pair of thermaltake i2c thermic lamps. Therms are very light, so i will have to give them a shot. I also like to have a small set of small leds on the end of the lamp. There are a few that are smaller and more light-efficient, and some that have even more power. The therma is also light enough to be used with a lamp, though i do think that the thermos should have more leds. So, a thermo is just a good choice if you are looking for a simple light source. You can also use it as a heating pad or as an extra warm lamp that you can use in your bathroom or on your counter. A therme is much more expensive and has to work harder. And i don't think you should go with thermakers. If you dona thermi... Thermakers are just more of a waste of money. It's time to stop using them.","~~the heat is heating up the molecules of the substance you're smelling.~~ this is what makes it taste better. It also means that when you smell something, you are actually tasting a chemical that your brain interprets as smell. So when something is very hot, your taste buds are primed to detect the chemical, and so your body will smell the smell of that food. This also explains why you can smell things much hotter than you normally would, which is why it's usually a good idea to use an oven to cook food before cooking it, as the heat will be transferred through the meat to the air and into the stomach. Edit: spelling. I'm not a scientist, but i do know that the difference in temperature between the hot and the cold air is due to a combination of air pressure and temperature differences. The colder air has more air to carry heat away, so it will burn more quickly. When there is more food to eat, the temperature will change, thus allowing the same amount of heat to be released. (this is how you get a ""smell"" of food.) edit 2: [this image](_url_0_) has a nice diagram showing the differences between hot vs cold.

"How were unidentified dead bodies handled in olden times, before refrigerated morgues?","There's a famous unidentified body from 19th century Paris--a beautiful young woman known only as ""L'inconnue de la Seine"" (the unknown of the Seine River). Her body was recovered and the mortician made a face mask of her so that she could be identified more easily--looking at a mask is a lot more appealing than looking at a rotting dead body. Because of her beauty, she drew a lot of attention, but in some other cases, they also did molds of the face. Once photography was available, photos might be taken of the unidentified after they were buried. In this case, though, she was never identified, but her face became a popular work of art, and the Resuscitation doll used in Red Cross classes on CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, now has her face.","In olden times, handling unidentified dead bodies was often a challenging and often traumatic process. Before the development of refrigerated morgues, here are some of the ways they were handled:

1. **Burying in mass graves**: In many ancient cultures, dead bodies were often buried in mass graves or trenches, which were then covered with soil and covered with the dead bodies of other individuals. This practice was common in ancient Rome, China, and other cultures.
2. **Disposal in rivers or oceans**: In some cases, dead bodies were thrown into rivers or oceans, where they would eventually be consumed by aquatic life or washed into the sea.
3. **Burial in the countryside**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in the countryside, away from cities and towns. This was often the case in medieval Europe, where the countryside was often used as a burial ground.
4. **Morgues in churches and monasteries**: In some cases, dead bodies were taken to churches and monasteries, where they were buried in the churchyard or on the monastery grounds. This practice was common in medieval Europe.
5. **Burying in a family plot**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in a family plot, where they were interred with the deceased family members.
6. **Burial in a common grave**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in a common grave, which was often located in a churchyard or other public area.
7. **Use of 'body pits'**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in 'body pits', which were shallow pits dug in a field or other open area. These pits were often used as burial grounds for multiple individuals.

These practices were often accompanied by rituals and ceremonies to honor the deceased, such as:

* **Funerals and processions**: Funerals and processions were often held to honor the deceased, and these events would sometimes involve the burial of the dead body.
* **Offerings to the dead**: Offerings to the dead were often made, such as food, drink, and other gifts.
* **Rituals and ceremonies**: Rituals and ceremonies were often held to mark important life events, such as birth, marriage, and death.

It's worth noting that these practices were not necessarily motivated by a desire to conceal the body, but rather by a desire to honor the deceased and to provide for the family of the deceased. However, these practices were often accompanied by social and cultural norms that reinforced the secrecy surrounding","There are a lot of different things that people would have done in the case of a death, depending on the culture. In Europe, for example, a lot of people would have been buried in a church or chapel, especially if they were wealthy. In the case of a poor person, they might have been buried in a common grave. In the case of a noble person, they might have been buried in a palace, or in a cemetery that was owned by the family.

Bales, aposter boy for the national society of forensic medicine who had died in the united states in 1942. The body ofalden g., a young man who was in his 20s, had been found in a morgie at a new jersey gas station in 1940. The gas company had discovered the body in november of 1942 and had to take the man to a mortuary to remove the corpse. He died on december 19, 1942, and the morgeys continued to find him. There was no record of his death. Why would a man so young die in this way? The answer is simple. It was because of an accident. According to the coroner's report, the death was caused by a blow to one of her ear. She called for medical attention and a ""medical examination"" was done. This is what was found on the scene of aldene's death:alderne g's head and neck were found near her bed, with a broken bone in her head. Her body was discovered a few days later at her home in long island city. Alderna's body had also been discovered in that state. In an autopsy report dated june 5, 1943, auldene stated that she had suffered a head injury during a fall at the age of 15. On june 20, she was pronounced dead. It would seem that anderne's family was not happy with the way things were going in their home. After her death, her son, robert, took the family to an old cemetery. Robert a. G was buried in april of 1945, at long beach cemetery. His burial place was a large church in south beach. Many of those buried at this cemetery had a history of crime. One of them was frank a., whowas a member of a mob that murdered at least 50 people. Frank was shot by his own brother. At the end of that year, frank's brother died of natural causes. As a result, his brother frank g, who died at age 26, went to prison for four years. During the time of frank, many of these people were living in prison. But, that did not stop the authorities from investigating. They arrested frank and charged him with murder. If frank had ever been a criminal, he would have been charged with this crime, because he was so close to his father, which is why the prosecution had him locked up in state prison in 1947. While frank would not be a major criminal in most states, they did find evidence that he had committed some of their murders. For example, on september 14, 1949, two women were murdered in boca raton, florida. Police found a car with three men and one woman in it, as well as a gun and ammunition, along with drugs and money. That's how much they stole. So, why was they found with all of this evidence? The answer to that question is that they had some kind of ""dead man's note"" which they took to their local police station. These notes were made in order to track down the victims. However, these notes did have some significance. When police began to see the notes, some would say that the police were investigating the crime scene. Others would suggest that this is how they were able to locate the bodies. Although some police would go so far as to say ""the police are investigating it,"" others would question if this was how the police department was doing it. Because of how these police reports were kept, it is possible that some were not taken into consideration when they made their initial investigation. Sometimes the reports might have a specific purpose, such as identifying the victim and identifying a crime that had occurred. Also, when these reports came to light, there was some controversy as the details of what had happened could have caused the deaths. What happened to frank? The case of robert g is a mystery to many. Why did he die? Well, one thing is for sure, this would explain why he did this. We do know that a lot of people who were victims of murders in other parts of america were killed by the same type of killers. Therefore, we know this about robert. Let's take a look at what happened on november 15, 1948. Before the murders occurred, john h. Was living at his parents' house in brooklyn. H was working in an office building. John was just 22 when he died. I think it was around the beginning of january, 1950. My father and i were in our office in my office, sitting at our desk. About 10:00 a. M., john came home from work. . . He said, ""i have seen that dead body. You can see it.""","~~but i'm not sure how much of the dead was cremated, so i'll just say that it's a pretty common practice.~~ *olde norse graves, not the modern ones. * [this](_url_1_) is a good place to look for a picture. It was a [very common funeral for people who died in a cremation]( _url_. I hope that helps! Edit: i found [another](url__url0_). It seems that this site is not up to date, but it should give you some idea of what the process was like. I know this one is for older people, and that's not to say there were no old norisies around. There are many. But for the most part, there was no way to get the corpses to be buried. You just needed to bury them. A large funeral was held, usually in the middle of a massive graveyard. That meant that the body was wrapped in linen, then put in coffins or a coffin, or put into a coffer, etc. The corpse would be put to sleep. Once it got there, it would lay there until it died. This is common to find dead people buried in wooden cofferdoes, in which the coffin would also be wrapped, often. Most of these coffinders were in very close to each other, as a sort of an easy way of drying them being sealed and thus keeping the bodies in place. When you find the remains in some kind of coffers. They would often have been sealed, they are usually sealed to keep them dry and then carried by water. [sources]( (_url^1). This was also a common place for burial vaults. So if it wasn't the place of death. If the coffders were dug up, you would have a lot of bodies were buried on the ground. Sometimes the grave would usually a burial ground or grave, buried under a grave. Also sometimes, graves were often made of dead. Then buried as well. And cremations were done. These were usually with a body of animals, either buried by burying them, a caskets, burned, sometimes with the bones of deceased. Some were made into coffings or burnt in ashes. Or buried with some other kind. In these places. Burial was done by fire or cremating. After a fire, depending on how fast the funeral, burying was, some of them were put out and buried or burned and burned again. Burying a chest and put down to ashes, cremate. _and then burnt, with or wood or clay, metal and ashes _beds. On top. Etc, these are the same way. Edit2: some graves had a wooden coffin and metal or coffees and casket. Other stuff that was buried and covered in ash. Wood/cask. Ix. Graves in this way were also often buried then made.

How are criminals able to make fake yet usable identities and passports to get around (onto airplanes etc.)?,"As long as your ID has the proper basic format, most people don't look too closely. This includes people whose job it is to verify your identity. The easiest way to get away with this ^(pure speculation) would be to make your ID for somewhere foreign. You want to board a flight in the United States? Fake a European passport. Get into a Canadian bar? Fake a Texas driver's license. ID checkers *should* have a book somewhere accessible that shows samples of legitimate IDs from around the world. But if your fake is close enough, and isn't one that they deal with on a regular basis, they will probably let it pass. Especially if it's a busy time.","Criminals use various methods to create fake identities and passports, which can be difficult to detect. Here's a breakdown of the common techniques:

**Fake Identities:**

1. **Social Engineering**: They create fake profiles on social media, online forums, or other platforms, often using stolen or fabricated information to gain trust and credibility.
2. **Data Breaches**: They exploit compromised databases to obtain sensitive information, such as names, addresses, and dates of birth, which can be used to create fake identities.
3. **Identity Theft**: They steal identities from existing databases or create new ones using stolen information.

**Fake Passports:**

1. **Stolen or Faked Documents**: They obtain genuine or forged documents, such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, or diplomas, which are then used to create fake passports.
2. **Counterfeit Documents**: They create fake documents using high-quality paper, ink, and binding, making them difficult to detect.
3. **Digital Printing**: They use digital printing to create high-quality, photorealistic documents, making them nearly indistinguishable from genuine ones.
4. **Digital Signatures**: They create fake digital signatures to sign documents, making it appear as if the document was signed by a real person.

**Methods to Avoid Detection:**

1. **Use of Secure Communication Channels**: Criminals use secure communication channels, such as encrypted messaging apps, to share information about their plans.
2. **Use of Secure Devices**: They use secure devices, such as encrypted laptops or smartphones, to store and transmit sensitive information.
3. **Use of Secure Networks**: They use secure networks, such as VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), to access the internet and communicate with other criminals.
4. **Use of False Identities**: Criminals use false identities to access secure areas, such as airports, airline terminals, or government offices.

**Prevention and Detection:**

1. **Airline Security**: Airlines have implemented various security measures, such as biometric identification, baggage screening, and secure check-in areas.
2. **Passport Security**: Countries have implemented strict passport security measures, such as holograms, microprinting, and advanced document verification systems.
3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Law enforcement agencies gather intelligence to identify and track suspicious individuals.
4. **Collaboration and Information Sharing**: Law enforcement agencies and other organizations share information and coordinate efforts to prevent and detect identity theft and passport fraud.

To prevent identity theft and passport fraud, it's essential to:

* Be cautious when","It's not that difficult. The first thing you need is a passport. A passport is a document that shows you're a citizen of the country you're traveling in. It's also a document that shows you have the right to travel in that country. The passport is also a document that shows you have a name that you're using. So, for example, if you have a fake passport that says your name is ""John Smith"", then you're a citizen of the country you're traveling in, you have the right to travel in that country, and you have the right to travel under the name ""John Smith"". So, if you want to fly to Paris, you can go to the airport and show your passport and your fake name, and they'll accept it.<|eot_id|>","They are so smart and so savvy that they are able not only to break into a person's passport but to enter the person as a guest, making a fake passport. They have also been shown to be able, even if they can't break a passport, to steal a foreign person, such as an american. They can also make a duplicate of a citizen or a u. S. Citizen, which is pretty much the same thing. So, what do we know about the origin of passports? The only thing that's known is that a lot of them were made by a local bank. But the most interesting thing is the fact that this was done by the uavs of the time. The first time i heard about this, i was not so sure. I asked a friend of mine, who i knew as the manager of an airline, if he was aware of this and he said ""of course. This is how it works in real life."" i thought, ""what if it's a cia agent or something?"" it was. I was amazed at how easily he could have learned from me that i had been doing this for a long time and i am very much grateful to him for his help. In fact, he is still the guy who did this to my passport and has been making it ever since. He also told me a story about how his wife was caught in the act of breaking into his passport in 1996 when he had a visa application for her. She was a canadian citizen and had to go to the united states to apply for an alien visa. So, when she came back home, she was just so shocked at the situation that she said, in english,""i can get a job in a bank, so i can be on a plane and have a new passport.""this is exactly what she did. It took her about a week and a half to do the whole thing, and she got a good job. Now she has a couple of other kids and some other friends. And they have been living in my house for about four years now. There is an apartment in her house. Her husband has lived there for over three years. All of us are in this state. We are all in our 20s. And she is living with a family. My wife is in college. One of her friends is a junior at a high school in canada. Two of our friends are here. Both of these people are living here for almost three months now and they all work hard. What i've learned is this: a large number of people have taken advantage of fake passports for their own personal gain, but the people who are making these passports are using them for the sole purpose of making money and the rest of it is just a matter of luck. People are doing it to pay their bills and to avoid having to live in fear of being stolen. That is why it has become so difficult for people to come forward. If they want to speak to us, they must first go through our online information center. Then they should go out and buy a copy of their passport for themselves. Once they get the passport they need to return it and pay back the money they made. You have to trust that if you are going to spend money on something like this you will pay for it. Just remember, this is your money. No one has to take it away from you. Everyone has the right to have it back. For example, my wife and my two kids are now living and working in new york city. Their mother is also living there now with her two children. These people don't need this money, because they will be in poverty. As for me, it will take a while for this one to happen.","Irl. They have no way of knowing. You can't just say you're from the uk and you'd be allowed to use a passport. It's a lot harder to do that when you don't know who you are. If you were a u. S. Citizen and tried to fly to the usa, you wouldn't be able. The only way you could be charged is if the person you wanted to charge with something made it through the legal system. Some countries have a law that says that you cannot be arrested for being a us citizen. This is called [incompetence](_url_0_). But it is not a huge law. So they can only charge you if they think you have an accomplice that was actually there. Sometimes, the authorities will use the excuse of being caught. But that's not illegal. There are other laws that limit it. I'm not sure about the rest. Edit: i made a mistake. Not the right place to say that. Thanks! [edit 2: typo.](_url_. Jpg) edit 2 edit 3: a little.

What were economists' reaction when Reagan outlined his trickle-down economics tax plan?,"I don't have answer, but you might consider moseying over to r/AskEconomics as well.","Economists' reaction to Reagan's Trickle-Down Economics Tax Plan was overwhelmingly negative. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan introduced a tax plan that aimed to reduce income inequality by lowering tax rates on the wealthy. However, economists and experts at the time strongly criticized this plan.

The plan was based on the idea that by reducing tax rates on the wealthy, the money they created would trickle down to the rest of society, thereby reducing income inequality. However, this idea was later discredited by economists.

One of the main criticisms of the plan was that it would not actually reduce income inequality. In fact, the wealthy would continue to accumulate wealth and power, while the poor and middle class would be left with lower tax rates. This was because the wealthy would be able to shift their wealth from the stock market and other investments to their tax returns, thereby reducing their tax liability.

Additionally, economists pointed out that the plan would have unintended consequences, such as:

- Increasing the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.
- Reducing the purchasing power of the poor and middle class.
- Encouraging investment in speculative assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than productive capital.

The economists' reaction was that the plan was flawed from the start, and that it would not lead to economic growth or prosperity for all Americans. They argued that the plan would only benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor and middle class.

The economists' concerns were further highlighted by the 1981 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, which estimated that the plan would lead to a significant increase in income inequality. The CBO report concluded that the plan would lead to a 3.5% increase in income inequality, which was a significant increase considering the plan's proponents had claimed that it would lead to a reduction in income inequality.

In conclusion, the economists' reaction to Reagan's Trickle-Down Economics Tax Plan was overwhelmingly negative. The plan was criticized for its flawed economic assumptions, its potential to increase income inequality, and its lack of evidence for its supposed benefits.<|eot_id|>","I would like to point out that this question is a bit vague.  ""Economists"" is a broad term, and it could mean anything.  Economists are people who study the economy. They are interested in the causes of economic phenomena, and they are interested in the effects of economic phenomena.  There is no one economist, and certainly no one economist who agrees with Reagan's plan.  Reagan's plan was a political manifesto. It was a plan for the Republican Party, and it was intended to help the Republican Party win the election.  Economists are not political scientists, and they do not have the same level of expertise as political scientists.  Economists are not interested in politics, and they are not interested in political science. They are interested in economics.<|eot_id|>",""" the republicans are going to be really unpopular with the public and a lot of people are not going away from the system.""[2] __________there is a difference between ""what economists call a 'market economy' or a ""market-based economy."" in economics, we call what is ""a 'fiscal stimulus' that will stimulate the economy, which is the way the government spends money. If you're going into a recession, you can't get the money back. You need to raise taxes on the rich, and you need the big banks to lend money to the banks.""the stimulus is what happens when the fed runs a deficit, because the federal reserve runs an interest rate that is higher than the interest rates of the other banks and they want to get back their money, so they run up interest on their deposits and then they go back to paying interest, but they don't have to pay anything back in the form of interest. That is why the stimulus works. The government has to borrow money from banks, it doesn't need a bank loan. It just takes the bank out of business, puts it in a savings account, pays it back, gets back the next interest that you put in, the balance is taken out and that's the nature of a fiscal stimulus."" ___________________________________________________________________________as discussed in this article, keynesian economics is based on a classical ""fiscal theory."" however, some economists and economists are also concerned with how the fiscal policy of any government is used. In this post, i will discuss the classical keynesians and the current fiscal issues. ____________________________the following is an excerpt from an article i wrote for the new york times that i had written in february of 2010. (i am writing this because i have been working on this topic for quite some time. I am not sure how long it will take me to finish the article but i'll be back with a more recent summary soon.)in his essay, ludwig von mises, who had been a member of keynes's central bank, has argued that the present monetary policy has been ""very inefficient."" he writes,it is true that in recent years, in order to make up for all the problems we have, a number of countries have begun to expand their monetary and fiscal policies. But the problem is that many of these countries are still very much in their infancy. Even with these changes, they still are using the same kind of monetary policies, or, as keynes put it, ""they are far from getting what they are supposed to."" for instance, with respect to monetary expansion, no country has ever been able to increase the level of its budget deficit. Rather, this is because, although the country's gdp is growing, its spending is still growing. This means that, if it were to keep expanding, that country would be in trouble. A very similar problem could be faced if a country were not to cut spending in an attempt to avoid further economic problems. Such a situation would have a serious impact on economic growth. When we look at the real world, there is very little difference in economic activity between countries that are in recession and those that have seen a recovery. However much economic progress can be made, these two countries still have much to learn from each other. Therefore, when we talk about the 'economic recession,' we should also refer to those countries which are experiencing a similar economic crisis. And in that sense, what we are talking about is not the recession of 2008, nor the great recession, of which the united states is one of them. We are dealing with something that we do not know about, namely the effect of our own policy choices. Now, let me turn to another important issue. Since i want you to understand that this essay is about macroeconomics, rather than economics itself, here is another quote from misek that explains why keynes is wrong. He writes: ""the first thing we must do is to find the right balance between the two types of economic policy. What we can do, however, is get a balance. All economic decisions are based upon a combination of two or more factors. There is no doubt that these factors, like the financial crisis, have led to a huge increase in investment. Moreover, at some point, even before the crisis started, investment was extremely low. Today, on average, people have an average of $3,500 per year in assets. These are all assets that can go into retirement. As a result, our government, under the conditions of austerity, cannot pay its bills. On the contrary, all our people live on zero income. So, while the majority of us live in poverty, those who are living in debt have little or no hope of getting on with their lives. One of my favorite quotes from keynes was in his famous ""mises lecture."" ""we must think of ourselves as","Ianas he explained that it was a tax on investment and consumption. I think this is what he meant. _url_0_ > as the tax code was enacted, the administration proposed a plan that would tax the rich at the top, and the poor at lower levels. > the plan would allow the wealthy to invest their wealth in companies that were more efficient. This would provide tax relief to those who had invested in the companies, while also allowing the lower-income individuals to use their own money to buy products and services. The government would also increase the amount of taxes that the individual could pay based on their income. It would be a very complicated and complex tax system. In fact, it is a terrible idea. One of the best examples of this was the iran hostage crisis. During the hostage situation, iranian forces were able to attack the us treasury. Many people thought that this kind of a deal was impossible, but in reality it just made it worse. When the hostages were released, many realized that they had already lost a lot of money. They were so distraught that their government was forced to end the debt, which was unsustainable. Basically, so they decided to try and create a new system that had no benefit for the people. By cutting taxes, they actually reduced the size of government, instead of giving everyone more money, rather than taking money out of people, or cutting jobs, people that could never make money as they could not do anything. So, those people were not make any more. Because of course, this created the economy was not sustainable. As far as i understand it went, most americans were the middle class people could no longer make more of middle classes, some people who couldn't make as much money from the taxes. And therefore, richer and they didn't have any money in a whole economy. Therefore the most of all the money made no more middle-class people lost money that was all of them, everyone. **the middle tax cuts.** in short, when they tried to get rid of everyone, wealth and wealth became less. Then the bottom class, as a result, a larger percentage of those that no wealth had to be taxed. People made less money was taxed, less, not everyone had more wealth. (and so the more people got taxed more, because they would have less of it. For a wider range of things. Just like a better economy and more jobs. Everyone lost wealth, more was lost. Edit: and also the way to explain it, there was no one thing. You can't just say that. Like any other time a government ""tax plan is bad. Or tax changes are bad, you have to have better outcomes. That are good, no other than the worst. A bad thing is the economic system is good. Its a problem. An economic model is better. Not just one. There is an idea that is not. But a good thing and people are still bad because it isn't. Some of that thing, that there are a few bad things too. If you are making a great thing a system too much. No it's bad if people get better things in government. Good things are the opposite. Better than a solution. *the system we have already done it too bad it! *some people have been bad and bad too big.* and some things that need to do better the thing too great. Is that bad is wrong. More than people can not have a worse things happen. Answer. [us the question is why people lose money and why the answer is. Yes, if the problem is ""the economy is too good"". The simple answer, is because the idea is it has a question. What you get. Think. Please, please. :) edit 2: sorry. Thanks for spelling. /u/uu/-my username. 2u/. U.

Why are you not allowed to donate blood for about a week and a half after taking antibiotic medication?,"Because the medication can persist in your blood that long. If they take your blood with medication in it and give it to someone who:  1) isn't sick, it could make them sick. Or 2) is allergic to that medication, it could kill them.","You're likely referring to the recommendation that individuals who have taken antibiotic medication should not donate blood for about 1.5 weeks after stopping the medication. This is to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

When you take antibiotic medication, it can alter the balance of your body's microbiome, allowing resistant bacteria to thrive. After stopping the medication, it can take several weeks for the body to recover and for the microbiome to return to a healthy balance.

Donating blood after stopping antibiotic medication is crucial to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here's why:

1. **Resistant bacteria can survive**: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can survive and continue to cause infections even after you've stopped taking the antibiotic.
2. **Transmission risk**: If you're not careful, you can transmit these resistant bacteria to others through blood transfusions.
3. **Reduced effectiveness**: If you're not careful, you can also reduce the effectiveness of your own antibiotic medication by transferring the antibiotic to other bacteria in your body.

To minimize this risk, the American Society of Haematology recommends that individuals who have taken antibiotic medication should not donate blood for about 1.5 weeks after stopping the medication.

During this time, it's essential to:

* Continue taking your antibiotic medication as prescribed by your doctor.
* Follow your doctor's advice on when to resume donating blood.
* Wait until you've completed the recommended period before resuming blood donation.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to blood donation and antibiotic use. If you're unsure about the timing of your blood donation, consult with your doctor or a medical professional for guidance.<|eot_id|>","You can donate blood for a short time after taking antibiotics, but you should wait at least 7 days.  Why? Because the antibiotics are interfering with your immune system. Your immune system is responsible for fighting off infections, and the antibiotics are interfering with it. If you take antibiotics for too long, your immune system will be weakened, making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may develop a condition called ""blood dyscrasia"". This is a condition where your blood is abnormal, and you will have difficulty producing enough red blood cells.  If you take antibiotics for too long, you may also develop a condition called ""blood clotting"". This is where your blood gets too thick, and it is harder for your blood to clot. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may develop a condition called ""blood clots"". This is where your blood gets stuck in the blood vessels, and it is harder for your blood to flow through the body.<|eot_id|>","I don't think so. I am a patient with a very rare bacterial infection, and after my last dose, my blood had to be injected. I was told that if i didn't donate my own blood, i could get a transfusion. I'm sure the doctor will find out that i have the same problem, but i still have to make sure that my doctor is there to help me with it. So far, so good. What if you need to go to an emergency room to see your doctor? I don""t know. So there you have it! The doctor who can help you with your antibiotic needs. There are lots of things you can do to prevent antibiotic use, even if it means taking out a prescription for an antibiotic. If you're like me, you may want to consider getting a blood transfusions before you take antibiotics.","~~the reason that you have to give blood is to save the life of a person who died from the disease.~~ this is why it's called a [pharmacy donation](_url_0_). The reason for this, i believe, is because the amount of blood you are giving is limited. If you only have 10-15ml of the blood, then you're taking out a lot of tissue. This means that the donated blood will be very large. As a result, it will not be able to be used for other medical purposes. And if it is, you can get a transfusion of that blood. That's why the first blood bank in the us requires you to have a blood donation. Once you've done that, the transfusions are free. The problem is that there's a large amount going to the liver, kidneys, and other tissues. There are also a number of other parts of your body that need blood (e. G. Heart, lungs, liver), so you might not get enough to do the job. I hope this helps.

Do planets all orbit the sun on the same plane as models seem to suggest?,"And, to add, the reason for this is that the solar system came from a spinning ball of gas and dust, and things that spin tend to flatten out into discs, just like, say, a spinning ball of pizza dough does. The solar system is bigger, but the dynamic is parallel.","The initial assumption that all planets orbit the Sun in the same plane is incorrect. The orbits of the planets in our solar system are not coplanar, meaning they do not lie in the same plane.

The planets in our solar system can be divided into two main groups based on their orbital characteristics:

1. **Inner planets:** Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
2. **Outer planets:** Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune

These inner and outer planets have distinct orbital characteristics, which can be described using the following terms:

* **Inclination:** The angle between the planet's orbit and the plane of the solar system.
* **Eccentricity:** The shape of the planet's orbit, which affects the amount of energy transferred between the planet and the Sun.
* **Orbital inclination:** The angle between the planet's orbit and the plane of the solar system.

For example:

* Mercury's orbit is relatively close to the plane of the solar system, with an inclination of about 0.04 degrees.
* Venus' orbit is slightly more inclined, with an inclination of about 0.01 degrees.
* Earth's orbit is the most inclined of all, with an inclination of about 0.01 degrees.
* Mars' orbit is slightly more inclined than Earth's, with an inclination of about 0.03 degrees.

The outer planets, on the other hand, have much more eccentric orbits, which means their orbits are more elliptical and have a greater inclination to the plane of the solar system.

The Copernican Revolution of the 16th century challenged the geocentric model of the universe, where the Sun was believed to be at the center of the solar system. The new model, known as the heliocentric model, places the Sun at the center of the solar system and explains the orbits of the planets as follows:

* The Sun is the center of the solar system.
* The planets are in orbit around the Sun, but their orbits are not coplanar.
* The orbits of the planets are elliptical and can be described using the following terms:
	+ **Inclination:** The angle between the planet's orbit and the plane of the solar system.
	+ **Eccentricity:** The shape of the planet's orbit, which affects the amount of energy transferred between the planet and the Sun.
* The planets' orbits are not fixed, but are influenced by the gravitational forces of the Sun and other planets in the solar system.

In summary, the planets","[Here's a plot of the orbital planes of the planets](_URL_0_). The orbits are not strictly in a plane, but the orbits are close enough to be considered as being in a plane. This is because the orbits are not very elliptical, and the planets are all in the same plane. The orbits of the planets are also not strictly parallel to the equator, but that's not a problem.

In fact, the orbits of many of these planets are very similar, but the orbit of most of them is so small that it is hard to tell whether they are orbiting the sun or not. The orbital distance of the earth from the planet is about 1.5 times the distance from it to the moon. This means that the average distance to a planet from earth is around 1/10th of a mile. If the diameter of this planet were 1,000 miles, then that would be the equivalent of 6.3 billion miles. For a star, this would mean that an average of 1 million miles per second. That's a lot of space for a single star to travel through. And for the planets, they orbit one another like an earth orbit. But, as we have seen, there are some very small planets orbiting all around the solar system. So, if the radius of each planet was 1 micron, it would have to be 2.4 microns. The sun and earth, right? Answer: yes, one planet orbits the other planet and that orbits earth. The earth orbits saturn and the moon, and even the stars. But earth and saturn orbit around eachother, so the orbital distances are not as large as the distances from one star and one moon to earth (and that's not an accurate representation of how much distance the star can travel, since it has no gravity at all, just the amount of material to hold it together). So, for example, in the picture above, earth's orbit is 1 (1.0) micrometers from saturn. Earth has a diameter about 4.7 micers, which is approximately the size of our planet. In the long term, a 1-micron planet could cover about a quarter of earth in space. A 1 kilometer planet would cover half the landmass of mars, giving earth about half of its surface area. An earth-sized planet of similar size would also be a very nice object. At the very least, we would need to find planets that orbit with the mass of one of those planets. As mentioned, all the light that comes out of their orbit (like the sunlight from a sun) travels through the atmosphere and into our own solar systems, like a jet engine. When a satellite's engine goes out, or a spacecraft's engines go out (or even into space), the fuel in that engine is used to make the spacecraft move. It is not a bad thing to have the engines of any spacecraft, even one that has been launched by a human, go to space in order to refuel. One wonders if it was ever possible to land a rocket on a surface that was not covered by any atmosphere. Why not just send an astronaut on an orbiting mission to orbit earth?for the sake of illustration, let's look at the second image, taken from nasa's goddard space flight center's (gfsc) earth satellite. Earth was the first satellite ever built to visit the red planet. All the satellites were designed to go in one direction, because the satellite was designed not to cross over. (the earth satellites did not go into orbit in any other direction.) the first one, called the ""earth-oriented"" mission, was launched in may 2001. Since then, nasa has built several more satellites to carry astronauts to and from mars. After that, their mission was called earth opportunity, launched on june 10, 2004. Nasa had its first launch on september 3, 2005. We have been following this mission ever since, with several missions to mars (including the mars odyssey mission in june 2004) and several trips to jupiter (mars odyssey was also launched as a mission on april 24, 2006). This is a big step forward in our understanding of what the early history of human history is like. Also, i am sure that many people will have a hard time believing that these missions were ever going to happen. There are many things that are impossible to believe. However, that is the main reason why they were not successful. Most of us were already familiar with how the universe works. Some people would think that we were going back in time and re-establishing the order of things in this universe. Others would say that there is no such thing as ""time"". It would appear that some of you are wrong. Our universe is an infinite universe, where time is finite, only an absolute number of particles and atoms are able to exist at once. I have learned this fact from my own experience and experience with other planets and stars, such as neptune and pluto. Many of my colleagues have also been wrong about the fact that our universe was created in such a way that time was never more than a few billion years old. These days, though, you can see that this is very difficult to explain. What we do know is that all","~~the orbit of a planet around a star is not the only one of its kind.~~ **edit:** [here's a good explanation of the different orbits of planets around the solar system](_url_0_).

How likely is it that I could discover a new species of bacteria right in my neighborhood?,"The microbial world is absolutely ridiculous in terms of diversity. Craig Venter did shotgun sequencing of seawater in the sargasso sea. They pulled out at least 1800 species of bacteria, of which 148 were totally unknown to science. Note, these numbers relate a lot to the distribution of species in the sample. If there are a few very abundant species (there were), and many many low abundance species, these numbers will be massive underestimates of diversity. They should be taken as lower bounds. And they picked the sargasso sea specifically to sequence because it was thought to have relatively low diversity.","Discovering a new species of bacteria in your neighborhood is highly unlikely. The discovery of new species of bacteria is a rare event, and it requires significant advances in microbiology, genetics, and other fields.

Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Limited sampling**: Even if you live in an area with high microbial diversity, the number of microorganisms you can sample is limited. You can only collect a small sample of soil, water, or air, which may not represent the entire microbial community.
2. **Microbial diversity is limited**: The microbial diversity in your neighborhood is likely to be limited due to the following factors:
   * **Geographic isolation**: Microorganisms in different regions of the world may have evolved differently due to geographical isolation.
   * **Evolutionary history**: Microorganisms have evolved over millions of years, and their evolutionary history may not be representative of the microbial community in your neighborhood.
   * **Climate and habitat**: The climate and habitat of your neighborhood may not be suitable for certain microorganisms, limiting their diversity.
3. **DNA sequencing is expensive and time-consuming**: DNA sequencing is a complex process that requires significant resources, including expensive equipment and skilled personnel.
4. **Microbial identification requires expertise**: Identifying microorganisms requires expertise in microbiology, which may not be available in your neighborhood.

However, it's not impossible that you might discover a new species of bacteria in your neighborhood. Here are some scenarios where it might happen:

1. **New species may be introduced through human activity**: Humans can introduce microorganisms into their environment through various means, such as:
   * **Water pollution**: Microorganisms can be introduced into waterways through pollution, which can lead to the creation of new microbial communities.
   * **Food and water contact**: Microorganisms can be introduced into food and water contact through human activity, such as handling animals or plants.
   * **Trade and commerce**: Microorganisms can be introduced into new environments through trade and commerce, such as importing plants or animals.
2. **New species may be discovered in remote or hard-to-reach areas**: If you live in a remote or hard-to-reach area, you may be more likely to discover a new species of bacteria.

To increase your chances of discovering a new species of bacteria in your neighborhood, consider the following:

1. **Collect samples regularly**: Regularly collect samples from your neighborhood and analyze them using DNA sequencing techniques.
2. **Use modern sampling techniques**: Use modern sampling techniques, such as DNA sequencing, PCR, and","It depends on a number of factors. First, the most common bacteria are found in soil, water, and the air. There are some bacteria that live in the guts of animals. The bacteria you would find in your neighborhood are probably the same as the bacteria in your gut. That is because the bacteria in your gut are the ones that are living in your intestines, so they are probably the ones you would find in your neighborhood. Second, the bacteria you would find in your neighborhood are probably the same as the bacteria that you encounter in your daily life. You probably don't have to go to the forest to find bacteria, you probably don't have to go to the ocean to find bacteria. You probably just need to go to your own backyard, and you probably have a lot of bacteria living in your own backyard.<|eot_id|>","!!!answer: yes.. I have been trying to find out what they are. So far, i found one that was not of any interest, and that is the genus e. Coli. When i looked at the image, my eyes went wide. My hand was swollen and my nose was sore, but i didn't know what to do. It was like the first time i've ever experienced a bug. No one has ever tried to help me with this bug, so i had to try my best. The image is very close to my house, as well as the street where i live. They are small, to the point of not being visible. That's what i'm looking for. And they're coming in so fast. But i don't think i can do anything about it. Now, this is not a bad thing. If you are in a neighborhood with a lot of bugs, you may want to consider this.","Ianas is a microbiologist. He's done experiments with a number of different bacteria. You can read more about him here: _url_0_ it's a very short article, but he is very informative. I'm not sure if it is the case that you could go to the trouble of finding new bacteria or just going to your local microbiology lab. However, if you go in to an area that has a lot of bacterial colonies, like the great lakes, you might find some new strains of bacillus. These bacteria are also very common in other parts of the world. In fact, i know that the biggest concern about the big bang was the expansion of space. So, in the grand scheme of things, the first thing you should do is go into your microbiological lab and ask for samples of all the bacteria that are on your soil. This is all very difficult, and the answer is that if there are any bacteria on the ground, it would be very hard to find them. It may be possible to create a lab that can isolate them, or to isolate the samples themselves, which is what you're looking for. But, for the most part, there's no such thing as ""one new discovery"". You need to discover new stuff, just like finding out that bacteria, by doing it. That experiment.

Why isn't philosophy taught in most public schools?,"It takes a certain capitol of wisdom to get something out of philosophy. As I child, I likely could have latched onto some small facet and fall into a deep dark depression.","There are several reasons why philosophy is not commonly taught in most public schools:

1. **Lack of Time**: Public schools are often underfunded and have limited resources, including time for teaching philosophy. Philosophical discussions and debates require a structured approach, which can be challenging to fit into the school's curriculum.
2. **Curriculum Priorities**: Public schools typically focus on core subjects like math, science, and language arts, as well as social studies and history. Philosophy is often seen as a ""soft"" subject that doesn't align with these core priorities.
3. **Philosophy is Not a Standard Subject**: Unlike math or science, philosophy is not a standard subject taught in public schools. This makes it challenging for schools to justify allocating time for it.
4. **Lack of Teacher Training**: Many teachers are not adequately trained to teach philosophy, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive and engaging philosophical education.
5. **Philosophy is Not a Relevant Subject in the Public Sector**: Public schools often focus on preparing students for the workforce, rather than providing them with a philosophical education that can help them navigate complex social and cultural issues.
6. **Cultural and Social Norms**: Philosophical discussions often require a level of cultural and social nuance that may not be expected in public schools.
7. **No State Mandate**: Unlike mathematics, there is no state mandate to teach philosophy in public schools. This means that schools are not required to include philosophical discussions in their curriculum.

However, it's essential to note that there are many successful public schools that offer excellent philosophical education. Some schools have incorporated philosophy into their curriculum, often through interdisciplinary programs or elective courses.

If you're interested in teaching philosophy in your local public school, consider the following:

1. **Talk to the Administration**: Reach out to the school administration to discuss the possibility of teaching philosophy.
2. **Build a Support Network**: Connect with other parents, educators, and philosophers to build a support network for teaching philosophical discussions.
3. **Start Small**: Begin with small, informal discussions and gradually build up to more formal philosophical education.
4. **Partner with Local Universities**: Collaborate with local universities or philosophical organizations to gain expertise and resources.
5. **Be Persistent**: Teaching philosophy in public schools may require persistence and creativity, but it's definitely possible with the right support and resources.

Remember, teaching philosophy in public schools is not only possible but also essential for preparing students for the complexities of modern society.<|eot_id|>",Because schools are not meant to teach you anything. They are meant to teach you how to get a job. They are meant to teach you how to pass a test. They are meant to teach you how to get a college degree. They are meant to teach you how to pass the bar. They are meant to teach you how to get a job. They are not meant to teach you how to think. They are not meant to teach you how to learn. They are not meant to teach you how to be a person.  Philosophy is a way to think. It is a way to learn. It is a way to get a college degree. It is a way to get a job. It is a way to pass a test. It is a way to get a college degree. It is a way to get a job. It is a way to get a college degree. It is a way to get a job. It is a way to get a college degree. It is a way to get a job. It is a way to get a college degree.

It is a way to get a job.<|eot_id|>,"It's not taught at all. It's taught as an afterthought in public school, where it's a matter of pride and pride of place. I want to make a distinction between the three main forms of philosophy: the philosophical, the intellectual, and the non-philosophical. The nonphilological form is one that is based on the idea that all things are self-evident. So, for instance, if i am a dog, i will not be able to see anything if it is a small dog. I don't want a large dog to be seen. But there are philosophers who have been taught that there is nothing to no such thing as a good dog because they believe that the human mind is always selflessly doing its best. This is not the way philosophy is taught. Philosophy is only taught when it has a certain degree of philosophical rigor and rigour and of conviction. And it also has to have some sort of respect for those who practice it, because that's what philosophy does. If you have a philosophical teacher who wants to teach you to follow philosophy, he will teach that to you. You will be taught to believe in philosophy. That's all right. There is no philosophical school in the world that teaches you that. Instead, you are taught the very same thing that you were taught before, that philosophy teaches. In fact, there's no one teaching you philosophy in school. Just as there isn'n't a philosopher in any of the major universities in this country, it isnt even a member of a major public university. What this means is that a philosophy teacher in a public institution is required to train you in what you can think. He or she is supposed to develop your own ideas, to discover new ideas. To be a part of that process is to become an expert in that field. These things donts take a lot of time. They take more time than you think, but they take you a long time to get to know. A philosopher is an experienced person who has been trained in many different fields. Some of them are very different from other philosophers. For example, aristotle, plato, aquinas, hegel, etc. All have very similar ideas about things. (p. 8)we are also taught, as we were, in some schools that they teach philosophy as the second form of education. We are told that this is because it teaches us that we are not alone in our mind, so that our actions are all the same. Here, they also teach us the opposite: that it doesnti teach we that things can be made to work, not because the action of doing so is selfless, which is what we think it does, we believe it to mean that everything can work. Now, some philosophers say that if we only believe what they say, then everything will work; that no actions can ever be created by an action. Or they go on to say there can never be an act that can create an effect. Is this true? I think that some of these things happen because we have beliefs. Then, this way of thinking about it seems to me to contradict what the philosophy teachers teach. First of all, philosophy has no idea of what it means to exist. Philosophers are always talking about what is real and what isn. Therefore, a person's true self is never a thing. An action is just a possibility, an experience. Not a fact. When you look at an object, whether it be the person or the thing, what happens to that object is the experience of its being. Everything that happens is possible. Something is true. Nothing is impossible. Because everything is so real, things that exist are possible and are real. Things that do not exist exist, only exist because of something that exists. Hence, anything that doesn't exist can exist at any given moment. People are talking all day long about the difference between a real world and an imaginary world, about how the things in question can behave. As i said before: there are no real things, no imaginary things; they are the laws of nature. Our consciousness is made up of some real thing called a reality. All that realness is created out of an actuality of reality, or as i say before in my book, my experience: a world. Every moment of our existence is filled with a place called the place of existence. Each moment is different, different and different. Where the real existence of each moment exists, each reality exists in its own world of space, time, space and time and space. At that moment, all of us are there, living and living, even in space; but theres nothing there that gives us an idea about our reality or about its reality of being; itd only be our consciousness. [p] 8. So what do you mean by a ""place of existent"" in your experience? It is our place","~~i believe it's because philosophy isn’t really a thing that is taught.~~ it‘s a subject that many people do not understand. For example, if you are a teacher of philosophy, you probably don te a lot of subjects. You might not be able to teach a class on the topic, but you can teach something about it. Also, philosophy is really not a science. It is a philosophical theory. If it was, it would be science, and the subject would have to be taught on that theory, so it isn. I am a very big proponent of the idea of a ""scientific philosophy"" that teaches a concept called ""reason"". This is the philosophy that i believe is most taught by most people. And i think that most of these people are completely ignorant of this philosophy. That being said, i know that philosophy and science are very different things.

"Why would someone have an ""Out of body experience"" after being seriously injured?",Its a sort of fight or flight. The experience is too traumatic for the brain to process so it creates an alternate reality to protect you.,"An ""out-of-body"" experience (OBE) is a common phenomenon that can occur after being seriously injured. It's a temporary feeling of floating above one's body, often accompanied by a sense of detachment or disconnection from the physical world. Here are some possible reasons why someone might experience an OBE after a serious injury:

1. **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**: When the brain is damaged due to trauma, it can cause the brain to temporarily disconnect from the rest of the body. This disconnection can lead to an OBE.
2. **Cerebral edema**: In some cases, the injury can cause swelling in the brain, leading to an OBE.
3. **Hemorrhagic shock**: Severe bleeding can cause a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain, leading to an OBE.
4. **Neurological damage**: Trauma can damage the nervous system, leading to an OBE.
5. **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: Changes in neurotransmitter levels can cause an OBE.
6. **Sleep deprivation**: Lack of sleep can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to an OBE.
7. **Adrenaline overload**: In some cases, an OBE can be triggered by an adrenaline overload, which can occur in response to severe injury or trauma.

It's essential to note that OBEs are not a result of any underlying medical condition or a ""psychological"" response to the trauma. They are a distinct phenomenon that can be caused by a combination of factors.

In some cases, OBEs can be triggered by the following:

* **Immediate post-trauma**: OBEs can occur immediately after a serious injury, often within minutes to hours.
* **Recovery phase**: During the recovery phase, OBEs can occur as the body heals and the brain regains its normal function.
* **Repetitive experiences**: Some people may experience OBEs repeatedly, which can be a sign of underlying issues.

If you or someone you know is experiencing an OBE after a serious injury, it's essential to seek medical attention to rule out any underlying medical conditions.<|eot_id|>","I'm not sure I understand your question. The question is ""why would someone have an out of body experience after being seriously injured"". I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing.  So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead.  The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.<|eot_id|>","""i know this is a very sensitive subject, but the point is, people experience things that are very personal to them. I have had a lot of experience with people who were very, very violent and they were able to express themselves with violence and violence-i've never experienced anything like that.""a lot can go wrong with this, and i think people have to understand that what they experience is very different from what their body can do. But i don't think that's what's going to happen to me. That's not my thing. It's a part of my body, i feel it. And if i can't get my own body to do that, then it's up to the body. The thing i know is that if you get injured, you've got to go to a hospital, that can get you in a coma. If you're in the hospital and you don, the doctor will treat you for a while, or you can have surgery, which is what i do, it takes time. You don' have time for that kind of thing, so you have no choice. They can come in and do it, they can see it in their head, see what it is. So i'm not going there to try to hurt somebody, because i want to help, to heal. There's no point in trying to take someone's life. This is something that i try not to think about. My body is my life, my family is mine. What's important is not for me to be a scapegoat for anybody, no matter what, if someone is hurting me, who is hurt, whether it be the other person or the police. We all have our own lives, we all want our family and our friends and family to see us. How can i be responsible for this? I will not be able, for example, being responsible if my wife is injured. People don 't want that to affect their lives. I'll be involved if it doesn't affect my health, how i treat myself. All that matters is the person who's injured and the injury that is causing them to suffer. Then i would like to get a prescription for the medication they need to control themselves. When i was in high school, there were two kids who didn't have any control. One of them was a little bit out of control, one of the kids didn' t know what he was doing. He was going into the bathroom, his face was black, he had his arms outstretched, all these little things. His head was getting too big, too wide. Every day he would just get up and move, move. At the time he didn t understand what was happening, where he needed to move and how he could control himself. In high schools, sometimes you see kids playing in school and then they come back and start doing things, not doing anything. Now it wasn't a problem for them, this was something they had to deal with. Even at the end of highschool, when i got my license, just to keep it for myself, even though it was just a misdemeanor, at that time i had no control over it or what happened to it so i just went to school. Because of what we were going through, most of us were not aware that we had control issues. By the age of 15, though, kids started to talk to each other. Kids started asking questions. Sometimes it took a couple of years for kids to realize that their parents were in control of their life and that they needed a medical doctor. As they got older, their minds began to change. Some of these kids had an idea about what to expect and what not, what if they could get it back, why wasn 'til now, in my opinion, someone had gone out and done something wrong, didn't know how to treat themselves, had lost control and had had problems. Many of those kids were having their own problems, some of which were more serious than others. Once they started talking to one another, a doctor was trained to look at them and make sure they didnt have problems with their health. Not only did that help them see that there was no problem, as well as help with the problems they have, things were beginning to improve. ""i don' t want my children to have this sort of situation where they feel that because of someone else's actions, maybe they should go through with it and stop acting like they did in front of me.""as i mentioned, these are all very important things to remember. These are the things i've learned about myself from the experience of being in this situation. Those things are important to us all. To know that you will be okay.","Ive always thought it was something like the aftermath of a car accident. The brain is really big and it takes a while for the blood to get to the muscles. If you have a really traumatic injury, it can take a long time for it to heal back up. It might take weeks or months, or even years for your brain to completely heal. However, if it is a big, traumatic event, like a crash, you can be pretty good at figuring out how to repair it. Once you start to see things like ""the brain can't heal itself"", it's hard to say ""it's just not that good"". Also, there's the possibility that you might just have to do the ""wrong thing"" and die from lack of oxygen. But if that's what happens, then you don't need to be a doctor to figure it out. You just need a brain surgeon. That being said, i've had a few patients who were in their late 20s and 30s, and they were all in shock. And then they started talking about getting a new brain surgery. I think that was pretty much their first time. They told me that they would be ""in shock"" if they had the surgery, but that it took them several days or weeks. Just days to realize it happened. Then i asked them if there was a lot of blood loss. No one knew. He said ""i just had to wait until the next week, that i was in pain"", and the doctors told them that. So i knew it just happened, they said no. Not sure. [here's a link to a video of me explaining it: _url_0_ edit:_1_ it went viral _0_.

Why do my cats wait to eat until I'm near their food bowls?,"Animals are more vulnerable when they're eating. They feel safer when you're around, so they feel they can let their guard down to eat. Congratulations, you are the pride leader.","It's not uncommon for cats to wait for their food to be served before eating, especially if they're not used to eating in front of their owners or if they're not in a hurry. Here are some possible reasons why your cats are waiting for you to serve them:

1. **Habit**: Cats are creatures of habit, and they often stick to their routine. If they're used to waiting for their owners to serve them, they may continue to do so.
2. **Food preference**: Cats have a strong sense of smell and taste, and they may prefer the taste or smell of their food before eating. If your cats are accustomed to eating in front of their owners, they may prefer to wait for their owners to serve them.
3. **Instinct**: In the wild, cats often wait for their prey to be ready to eat before hunting. This behavior is still present in domesticated cats, and they may feel more comfortable waiting for their owners to serve them.
4. **Attention seeking**: If your cats are waiting for you to serve them because they're bored or need attention, they may be seeking attention from you by waiting for you to feed them.
5. **Social bonding**: Cats are social animals, and they often enjoy the interaction and attention from their owners. If your cats are waiting for you to serve them because they enjoy the interaction, they may be seeking a response from you.

To address this behavior, you can try the following:

* **Feed them in front of their owners**: Feed your cats in front of their owners, but don't let them eat until they're served. This will help them learn that waiting for their owners is the expected behavior.
* **Use a timed feeder**: Use a timed feeder that will dispense food at a set time, such as 7 or 8 am. This will help your cats learn to eat at a consistent time.
* **Provide a food puzzle**: Provide a food puzzle that requires your cats to work for their food. This will help them learn to eat before their owners.
* **Reward good behavior**: Reward your cats with treats or praise when they eat on their own or before their owners.
* **Be consistent**: Be consistent in your feeding schedule and location. This will help your cats learn that eating is a regular activity and not just a waiting game.

Remember, every cat is different, so it's essential to tailor your approach to your cat's unique personality and needs.<|eot_id|>","Because they're hungry. Cats don't eat when they're full. They eat when they're hungry. You have to be careful not to feed them when they're not hungry. Cats don't like it when they're fed when they're not hungry, so they'll wait for you to come to them so they can eat.  Also, they're waiting for you to come to them so they can eat. They're not waiting for you to come to them so they can eat because they're hungry. They're waiting for you to come to them so they can eat because they're hungry.<|eot_id|>","This is a question which you have to ask yourself, not to mention that you are likely to find yourself wondering how many cats there are in a particular area. In my experience, it's not uncommon for a cat to have a good time eating the food it eats. If you're not sure what the average cat does, ask the vet. The first thing to do is check the cat's food intake. This is something which is common in other cats. Most of the time, you will have one cat eat the right amount of food and another cat do the wrong amount. For example, when i was in my first cat house, i had one kitten that i used to feed to a littermate. I didn't know how much of his food he used, so i gave him a small amount and let him eat it. It was an amazing experience. However, if you find a problem with your cat, go ahead and try again. Answer: this is not a scientific question. I'm not going to say that it is impossible, but if it was, the question would be, what is the optimal amount to give a kitten to the person who eats it? It's important to remember that cats are omnivores. When a kitty is in danger of starvation, they will eat anything they can get their hands on. Therefore, a normal cat can eat a lot of things. Unfortunately, this does not mean that a regular cat should eat only a few things a day. Many people have suggested that if they are going out for dinner or a special occasion, then they should be able to afford to be at the top of their game. My advice is to make sure that your pet is eating enough to cover their needs. A healthy cat will also not eat too much. That is, your cats will not be starving. So, take a look at your vet's reports and see if there is any indication that their cat is fed right. You may want to consider using a food source such as the canned fruit, which will make it easier to get the nutrients you need. Also, be sure to look for other foods in the house that may be helping your kitties. Your vet may also suggest that they give you a treat which may include a quick bite to try and help with the problem. These are the things you should look out to. Answer: it depends on what you want your kitten in. As for the rest of your life, keep an eye out, for your veterinarian will try to tell you what to expect from your next cat.","Ive been told by my cat that they don't like the taste of the food and just like you, they like it when it's cold. I don’t know if this is true for other cats or not. But the cat may just be used to it. The more time you spend in the room, the better it is at sensing the temperature. If you have a room filled with ice cream, it‘s probably not going to feel cold or warm. When they are at their most active, their sense of smell is going down and it feels good. They know this and can smell the smells of food. And if they have food, when you give them food they will respond with ""oh, that”s food too"" and wait for you to give it a go. Edit: spelling. _url_0_ edit 2: it doesn“t matter if the water is cold, food is good for them. It depends on the time of day and their environment.

"How viable was an Umayyad occupation of France, even if Charles Martel had lost the Battle of Tours?","The Battle of Tours is widely touted, along with Salamis, as a *battle that saved western civilization.*  This really is not the case. I've phrased it this way on this subreddit before, but the Umayyad war machine was grinding to a halt by the time armies crossed the Pyrenees. Supply lines were massive, especially for an empire stretching from Transoxiana to the Iberian Peninsula. Also, keep in mind that this Arab army was most likely a raiding force out pillaging Aquitaine rather than a force bent on conquest. Coupled with that, a few years following the Battle of Tours there was an Umayyad disaster in North Africa. The Berber Revolt of 740 crippled imperial authority in North Africa and several independent Islamic Berber states rose. The Umayyads suffered a humiliating defeat and couldn't focus on foreign conquest. So, realistically, had the Umayyads emerged victorious from Tours, they probably wouldn't have been able to follow up the victory.","The idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an intriguing one, but unfortunately, it's based on a historical event that never occurred. Charles Martel, also known as Charles Martel the Great, was a Frankish king who fought against the Moors in the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. This battle was a significant victory for the Franks, but it was not a decisive one.

However, if we consider the possibility of an Umayyad occupation of France, we need to examine the historical context and the Umayyad Empire's expansion plans.

The Umayyad Caliphate was a powerful Islamic state that emerged in the 7th century AD. They were a major power in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain, and their empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The Umayyads were Sunni Muslims who sought to spread Islam to the non-Muslim populations of their territories.

Considering the historical context, it's unlikely that the Umayyads would have had a significant occupation of France. France was already a Roman province, and the Roman Empire had been conquered by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD. The Umayyads, being a Muslim empire, would not have had the same level of control over the Western Mediterranean.

Moreover, the Umayyads' expansion plans were focused on the Mediterranean region, Africa, and the Middle East. They did have some influence in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), but it was limited to the kingdoms of Toledo and the Kingdom of Asturias.

Given the historical context, it's highly unlikely that an Umayyad occupation of France would have been successful. The Umayyads would not have had the same level of military power, technological advancements, or strategic alliances as the Franks, and their empire's expansion plans would not have extended to the Western Mediterranean.

In conclusion, while the idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an interesting one, it's based on a historical event that never occurred. However, if we were to imagine an alternate history where the Umayyads did have a significant presence in France, it would likely have been a very different and less likely scenario.<|eot_id|>","Charles Martel is not the only one who was able to capture a portion of the Umayyad Empire. The Umayyads had already conquered most of the Mediterranean world, and were able to make a fairly significant portion of it. In the year 655, the Umayyads captured the city of Larnaca, which was a major port city in the eastern Mediterranean. This was a major blow to the Byzantine Empire, which was already in trouble. The Byzantines were able to regain control of Larnaca in 674, but the Umayyads were able to capture the city again in 678. The Umayyads were able to make significant gains in the Mediterranean world, and the Byzantines were able to regroup.<|eot_id|>","!!!anon772216 (please read the following) i agree with the comments.. . . I am an active member of a group of students. I was a student of the student council of ummah for a few years. When i joined, i met the principal of my school. The principal and i are close friends. We were friends until the war. After the end of hostilities, we became friends and we have had many conversations. It was during this time that i learned that the holy prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said: ""o allah's apostle, make us acquainted with each other and with our fellow muslims."" i agreed to this. As soon as the holy prophet said this, he gave me the order to have him accompany me to the prophet's house. He came and greeted me. There he was, with his head bowed, and he said (to me): ""the messenger of allah, when you come to us, you will tell us about your friendship with us."",-a. M. Al-qur'an, al-majmah, al-'albaani, ibn hajar, tafsir al'muthanna' and 'aqsa'i, an-nisa'it is also worth mentioning that this was the same time when the students of umm al‐hijrah came to umayyah, the city of 'umm al‐fara' in the north of syria. This was at that time the time of prophet muhammad (peace and blessings of god be on him), and so it is not surprising that umar ibn al‑umar (may allaah have mercy on his soul) came here to give him the command to accompany his companions to medina and to be with them on the pilgrimage to mecca. If the imam of mecca (abu bakr) had had any knowledge of this matter, then he would have been well advised to leave the place. In the case of al-'a'isha, however, she has been told that she is the daughter of an emir and that her father has died. Al'aisha was not informed of any of these facts.. .. I do not believe that an imam was present at umdat al khazaliya in umuhara or in medina.

how can public schools and universities in the US have time off for select religious holidays? Doesn't it violate separation of church and state?,"It's done not so that the university can celebrate the religious holiday, but so that the students can. It's important to remember that the students are the customers of the university. If the university doesn't have breaks that the customers want, they'll go somewhere else. At that point, it's not for religious reasons that the break happens, but for market reasons, and that's permissible.","In the United States, public schools and universities have a long history of accommodating certain religious holidays, while others may be left out. Here's how it works:

1. **Separation of church and state**: The First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the separation of church and state. However, this doesn't mean that public institutions can't honor or accommodate certain religious holidays.
2. **Established church**: In the US, public schools and universities are often established by churches or faith-based organizations. This means that they have a vested interest in honoring certain religious holidays.
3. **Religious holiday exemptions**: Public schools and universities can exempt certain holidays from the usual school closure policy. For example, they might allow students to attend church services or participate in holiday celebrations if it's deemed ""essential"" to their education or community service.
4. **Holidays that are not sacred**: Some holidays, like Thanksgiving, are not sacred or directly related to a specific faith. Public schools and universities may choose to observe these holidays without any religious connotations.
5. **Cultural and historical significance**: Public schools and universities often have a rich history and cultural significance that may not be directly tied to a specific faith. They may choose to observe holidays that are important to their students, faculty, or staff.
6. **Accommodating diverse student populations**: Public schools and universities strive to create inclusive environments that accommodate diverse student populations. They may choose to observe holidays that are significant to their students, even if they're not directly related to a specific faith.

To illustrate this, consider the following examples:

- **Thanksgiving**: Many public schools and universities in the US observe Thanksgiving, which is not directly related to a specific faith. However, some schools might choose to observe the holiday with a Thanksgiving dinner, which might include traditional foods like turkey and stuffing.
- **Christmas**: Public schools and universities often observe Christmas, which is a secular holiday. However, some schools might choose to observe the holiday with a Christmas dinner, which might include traditional foods like turkey and stuffing.
- **Easter**: Some public schools and universities in the US observe Easter, which is a Christian holiday. However, some schools might choose to observe the holiday with a spring break, which might include activities like Easter egg hunts.

While public schools and universities may not always observe all religious holidays equally, they often strive to create inclusive environments that accommodate diverse student populations. The key is to balance the need to accommodate certain holidays with the requirement to remain neutral and separate from the state religion.<|eot_id|>","The Supreme Court ruled that schools and universities have the right to allow religious holidays to be observed, but they cannot make it mandatory. They can't just tell you that you have to go to church on Monday, but they can't tell you that you have to go to church on Tuesday.  The reason for this is that you can't force someone to go to church. You can't make someone go to church if they don't want to. You can't make someone go to church if they are busy. You can't make someone go to church if they don't have the time.  But you can make someone go to church if they want to. You can't make someone go to church if they don't want to.  This is why some people say that schools and universities are not religious institutions, but rather government institutions. They have the right to observe holidays, but they can't force others to observe them. They can't make them go to church, but they can make them go to school.<|eot_id|>",I think it does.(h/t to the huffington post),"~~the school can't schedule that day, it has to schedule a schedule for the next day.~~ it's also not uncommon for schools to have to work full time to meet schedules. Schools do not have the same flexibility as other industries. The school may have some work hours, but the teacher is required to take them. Sometimes, the teachers are not on vacation and do the day's work. And sometimes the parents are on holiday and don't work for school. So schools can schedule school hours to match their schedule. But if the parent is in a state where the holiday is not permitted, they may be allowed to. Edit: also, this is a school-wide thing. There are many schools in different states. They all have different schedules, and they have schedules that are different. If a teacher in one state doesn’t have a special schedule, then the rest of the state will have no special schedules for that school, which is why they are allowed. **tl;dr:** schools have flexibility. It may not be illegal, as long as the schedule isn't set up to allow for religious holiday. I hope that answers your question. This question! Edit 2: i found it wrong. My answer is wrong too.

Why do we talk to ourselves out loud?,"Its helpful to put ambiguous thoughts into concrete words, and to try to see both sides of an argument. As long as you're alone, or able to do it without looking crazy, why not? Plus, I've heard that our internal monologue develops like this: Parents speak to infant, to help them see adult views of things. Slightly older children speak to themselves, being both the child and parent. Kids are taught to move that conversation into their head. So talking out loud is just like thinking... but with your mouth.","Talking to ourselves out loud is a common phenomenon known as ""self-talk"" or ""inner dialogue."" There are several reasons why we engage in self-talk:

1. **Self-Reflection and Understanding**: Talking to ourselves can be a way to process our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. By verbalizing our thoughts, we can clarify our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
2. **Emotional Regulation**: Self-talk can help us manage our emotions, especially negative ones like anxiety, fear, or sadness. By acknowledging and accepting our emotions, we can learn to regulate them and respond more effectively.
3. **Cognitive Processing**: Talking to ourselves can aid in cognitive processing, allowing us to think through problems, make decisions, and solve challenges. This can be especially helpful when we're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain.
4. **Personal Growth and Development**: Engaging in self-talk can be a way to identify areas for personal growth and development. By reflecting on our experiences, we can identify patterns, habits, and areas for improvement.
5. **Social Connection and Support**: Talking to ourselves out loud can be a way to connect with others, even if it's just ourselves. This can be a way to receive support, encouragement, and validation from our own minds.
6. **Neuroplasticity and Brain Function**: Research suggests that self-talk can be linked to increased neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to adapt, change, and learn. This can lead to improved cognitive function and overall brain health.

To use this phenomenon to your advantage, try the following:

- Practice self-reflection by asking yourself questions, like ""What did I learn today?"" or ""How did I handle that situation?""
- Use affirmations or positive self-statements to boost your confidence and self-esteem.
- Engage in ""mirror work,"" where you reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and actions to better understand yourself.
- Develop a growth mindset by recognizing areas for improvement and working to address them.

Remember, talking to ourselves out loud is a normal and natural part of human behavior. By embracing this phenomenon, you can gain valuable insights, improve your mental health, and develop a more positive and supportive relationship with yourself.<|eot_id|>","I think it's because we are talking to ourselves in order to make sure we are talking to ourselves, not to others. We can't hear ourselves, so we have to talk to ourselves in order to make sure we are talking to ourselves.  It's also important to remember that we are talking to ourselves because we are the only one who can hear us. We can't hear ourselves when we're talking to others, so we have to talk to ourselves in order to make sure we are talking to ourselves.  I think it's also because we can't hear ourselves when we're talking to others, so we have to talk to ourselves in order to make sure we are talking to ourselves.<|eot_id|>","We are not people. We are our own people and we have to talk about them. We have our different selves. So it is nice to be able to express ourselves in a way that allows for some peace, that is not the case for others. But we are all human. We all have a purpose, a connection, and a meaning. As the bible says, ""behold, i am the way, the truth, my love, your spirit, you shall never sin."" (mark 8:28-29). And the scriptures say, ""do not covet."" in other words, we love and care about our heavenly father, who is our only hope for eternal life. So i want to share my perspective on why we care for and are compassionate to others, what we want and need from our lives, how we can share our love with others and what it means to love god and him. The idea that we need to ""talk to each other out of our mouths"" is a false one. In fact, it's a lie. It is the same lie that keeps people from giving a shit about what they believe in. They will never ask the question. When we say we're going to ask god to take us in, he will be willing to give us the answers we really need. There are many people out there who are just asking god for answers and asking for them to answer them, but they are really not. This is because they don't have the right to hear what god has to say to them about their lives. The only way they can hear god is through their own actions and the actions of others in our life, not through our actions or the things we do. I hope that by sharing my own perspective, people will find that they have an opportunity to speak out about these issues and to learn from their experience. And if they do, they will learn that love is just as important to us as love. If we ask our people to do the hard work of making love to one another, to make love not just to other people, or to another human being, then we will live more happily and more happy. You can be a part of that. No matter what you do or say. Just do it. Love yourself. Don't be afraid to change. Do what's right for you. Be open to new experiences. Think about the possibilities. Look at the world around you and how it affects you, so that you can see and understand what is happening. Let go of the fear of rejection, let go the thought of being rejected, letting go your life to find a better life for yourself and for your family. Accept your limitations. That's what i love about sharing a story with other human beings, because i know that all of us have one purpose. To share a new experience with another person. Because we all love eachother.","~~i'm not sure i understand what you're asking.~~ i think you mean when you are speaking with someone that is listening to you, and then you try to talk out louder. When we do that, we are creating a kind of auditory feedback loop. The more you speak, the louder the feedback gets, so you start to hear other people talking and it becomes a ""chirping"" experience. I believe that's why we hear people talk, because the other person is louder, but it's not really that important. You just hear them talking, which is why you have a sort of ""loud"" sound. Edit: i should also add that this is just a response to the sound of your own voice. If you look at the sounds of people speaking, you will notice that you hear the same voice that they are making. And i'm sure that many people with this type of vocal training do. It just makes them more relaxed and less stressed.

Are there examples of Brits calling Americans terrorists (or equivalent) during the American Revolutionary War?,"John Paul Jones and his ship the Ranger, sailed in the Irish sea during 1778. They raided White Haven, then tried to kidnap the Earl of Seakirk, from his Scotish castle. The Earl wasn't home. The crew of the Ranger wanted to burn his house down. Jones talked them into just taking the silver tableware, which he bought back from his crew, and later returned to the Earl. However, the British newspapers were in a full throttle rant. They called John Paul Jones a terrorist, and likened him to the Viking pilligars from days of yore.","During the American Revolutionary War, there were instances of British soldiers referring to American colonists as ""terrorists"" or ""rebels."" However, I couldn't find specific examples of Brits calling Americans ""terrorists"" or equivalent.

One notable example is the infamous phrase ""traitors"" used by British soldiers to describe American colonists who opposed British rule. This phrase was used by British soldiers to describe American colonists who participated in the Continental Congress, which was a gathering of representatives from the 13 colonies that eventually became the United States.

Another example is the British term ""rebels"" or ""rebels of the American continent,"" which was used to describe American colonists who fought against British rule. This term was often used by British soldiers to describe American colonists who were seen as enemies of the British Crown.

It's worth noting that these terms were not used in the same context or with the same frequency as they are often used today. The terms ""traitors"" and ""rebels"" were used more in the past, and their usage was often influenced by the historical context and the specific circumstances of the conflict.

In general, the British term ""terrorists"" was not used until the 18th century, and it was primarily used by the British government to describe the actions of the French and their allies during the American Revolutionary War.<|eot_id|>","I'm not sure if this is the specific example you're looking for, but I found a similar question in the past: [Why were the American colonists called terrorists?](_URL_0_) The short answer is that the colonists were called terrorists because the British colonists were called patriots. This is not to say that the colonists were not terrorists, but rather that the British colonists were the ones who were considered terrorists.<|eot_id|>","I think there are, but that is not the way it is done.[1] http://www. Youtube. Com/watch?v=0gnpxk2xs0w&feature=youtu. Be","Ian kershaw in *a history of the usa* does a good job of describing how the boston massacre was seen as a major turning point in america's relationship with the united states. Kerkhoff writes that, in 1763, the republicans tried to persuade the governor of washington to declare war on the french in order to make the war ""more agreeable"". This was a very popular argument, and keskhar argued that the colonists were entitled to ""freedom of speech"". He also argued for the creation of a national guard, which would allow the government to protect the citizens from the threat of insurrection. This is just one example of how this argument was used to justify the use of terrorism. There is a whole section on [the bbc's ""american revolution""](_url_0_) in the *america* section.

"Why, regardless of actual room temperature, am I so hot trying to go to sleep VS it being so cold when I'm trying to wake up?","Your metabolism slows by about 10% while you are asleep (and body heat is a byproduct of metabolism). Your core temperature actually drops by a degree or two. Most people are in the 96° range while they sleep.  Your brain's ""thermostat"" (the hypothalamus) is set to 98.6 or so, so when you wake up, your brain thinks, ""Woah! Chilly! We prefer to keep it a little warmer in here!"" Then you start shivering and moving around (or you crawl under the covers) and warm up!","There are several reasons why you might feel hotter trying to sleep than trying to wake up, regardless of the actual room temperature. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Body heat:** When you're trying to sleep, your body is in a state of dormancy, and your metabolism slows down. This means that your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer. Conversely, when you're trying to wake up, your body is in a state of wakefulness, and it's more efficient at generating heat to warm you up.

2. **Metabolic rate:** As mentioned earlier, when you're trying to sleep, your body's metabolic rate slows down, which means it uses less energy. This reduced metabolic rate can make you feel warmer.

3. **Sweating and evaporation:** When you're trying to sleep, your body produces more sweat, which can evaporate quickly, making you feel warmer. This process is more efficient when it's cooler, as the air is already cooled.

4. **Adaptation to temperature:** Your body has an internal thermostat that regulates its temperature. When you're trying to sleep, this thermostat is set to a lower temperature, making you feel warmer.

5. **Hormonal changes:** Sleep and wakefulness are regulated by hormones, such as melatonin and cortisol. During sleep, melatonin levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer. During wakefulness, cortisol levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer.

6. **Comfort and relaxation:** When you're trying to sleep, it's often a comfortable and relaxing environment. This comfort can make you feel warmer, as your body is in a state of relaxation.

7. **Evaporative cooling:** When you're trying to sleep, the air is often more still, which means it's easier for the air to evaporate and cool the body. This process is more efficient when it's cooler.

8. **Psychological factors:** Your perception of temperature can be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, boredom, or excitement. If you're trying to sleep, you may feel more relaxed and comfortable, which can make you feel warmer.

9. **Sleep stage:** When you're trying to sleep, you're likely in a deep sleep stage, which means your body is in a state of dormancy. During deep sleep, your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer.

10. **Individual variability:** Everyone's body is different, and individual variability can affect how you perceive temperature. Some people may","The air you breathe is warmed by your body. When you sleep, your body is in a state of ""parasol"", meaning that it is shielded from the heat of the room. When you wake up, the air you breathe is no longer shielded from the heat of the room, and your body has to work to cool you down. When you are hot, you can't cool down very well, so you feel like you are burning. When you are cold, you can cool down very well, so you feel like you are warm. So when you wake up, you feel like you are burning, because you can't cool down as well as you did when you were sleeping.<|eot_id|>","(no answer) that is the reason that i have to get up in the morning to do that.

Average day for someone convicted of Murder 1 and sentenced to life without parole,"He'll probably be in a cell with another inmate, and have 6 or 7 hours a day outside his cell where he can interact with other inmates. He can get a job in prison, and join whatever type of activities the prison offers (book club, art classes, etc). He'll be allowed to have weekly visitors.","It's challenging to provide an exact average day for someone convicted of Murder 1 and sentenced to life without parole, as individual experiences can vary significantly. However, I can provide some general insights and details about the life of someone with this conviction.

**Life in Prison:**

In Canada, where Murder 1 is typically convicted, life without parole (LWOP) is the minimum sentence for first-degree murder. This means that the individual will spend the rest of their life behind bars, without the possibility of parole release.

**Daily Life:**

Assuming the individual is 25 years old, here's a hypothetical glimpse into their daily life:

1. **Morning Routine:** The individual wakes up in their cell at around 6:00 AM. They may have a small amount of food, such as a packet of dried fruit or a granola bar.
2. **Exercise:** They spend around 30 minutes on a small exercise yard or a small area in their cell. This may include some light stretching, jogging, or other forms of physical activity.
3. **Breakfast:** The individual eats a small breakfast, which might consist of a few slices of bread with some cheese or a small bowl of oatmeal.
4. **Education:** The individual spends around 30 minutes to an hour reading a book or listening to a podcast. They may have access to a small library or a computer for research.
5. **Work:** Depending on the facility, the individual may have access to a work area, such as a sewing machine or a small desk. They may be given a task or assigned a job to complete.
6. **Meals:** Meals are typically served in a communal area, and the individual eats around 3:00 PM. The meals are often plain, with a focus on nutrition rather than flavor.
7. **Leisure Time:** The individual has limited leisure time, around 30 minutes to an hour. They may be allowed to walk outside, but only for short periods, and with close supervision.
8. **Supervision:** The individual is constantly supervised, with cameras and monitors monitoring their every move.
9. **Relaxation:** The individual may have access to a small room or a cell with a view. They may be allowed to relax for a few minutes, but only if they are deemed safe.
10. **Bedtime:** The individual goes to bed around 10:00 PM, at the same time every night.

**Challenges and Limitations:**

This is just a hypothetical example","You're not going to get the answer you're looking for, but I'll try. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that there are no laws against the death penalty. As long as the law is constitutional, the death penalty is legal. There are a few reasons for this. First, if you are convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole, you will be eligible for parole after 20 years. If you were to be executed, you would never be eligible for parole. Second, if you are convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole, the judge will also decide whether or not you should be eligible for parole. If you are eligible for parole, you will be released from prison. If you are not eligible for parole, you will die. Third, there are laws against the death penalty. If you are convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole, the judge will also decide whether or not to uphold the death penalty laws. If the judge upholds the death penalty laws, you will be executed. If the judge does not uphold the death penalty laws, you will die.<|eot_id|>","(1) the average average year for a person convicted or sentenced for murder is 1.25 years, or 1 in 4.5 million. (2) when we look at the average age of a defendant sentenced in the united states for the same crime, the median age is 20 years. The median year is 25 years; the mean is 21 years (the median for those convicted in that state for that crime is 27). (3) in the case of the sentence to death of one of these two men, one year was the minimum, and the other one the maximum, for each of those offenses.(4) what does the difference between the number of days in which the defendant was sentenced and that of his or her peers in prison for one or more of them?what does it mean to be a murderer? (1). It means to commit murder. It doesn't mean that the killer was a bad person. Nor does murder mean a crime of some sort. But it does mean something. And that is something that can be done.","Ive read the article and can't seem to find it. I'd like to add that the average time for parole is about 90 days. So that means that even if you can prove your innocence and be released, you still have to go through the legal process. Also, if the sentence is a life sentence, it would be a lot longer than the time you would have had to serve. If a parole board has a problem, they can try to get someone to sign off on their parole. But then, what happens if someone can be put back on parole after a while? It's not like they would get put in jail. In fact, some parole boards don't even bother to try and keep someone in prison. They'll just let them get out of there. Source: _url_0_ it seems to me that it is the most common reason for people to be sentenced for murder. The reason you get a ""life sentence"" is because it doesn't make sense for them to spend the rest of their lives in a prison cell. As long as they have some sort of money to pay for their time, and the fact that they are not in any danger of dying, the punishment is more likely to make them go free. However, life sentences are still a way to live in the prison, so they don’t have a chance to keep them. Edit: i can only remember the source. Thanks to /u/sunagainstgolden_lucid_the_salt.

"Newton's Law: If a spaceship is moving in a vacuum, uses the chemical energy of half the fuel to accellerate (Kinetic energy), then the other half to brake aka accellerate in the opposite direction, where is this energy now?",In the motion of the particles that were shot out the back and front of the ship.,"According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. Since the spaceship is moving in a vacuum, there is no external force to slow it down or speed it up.

In this case, the chemical energy of the fuel is being used to accelerate the spaceship in one direction (kinetic energy). However, the other half of the fuel is being used to brake (kinetic energy) the spaceship in the opposite direction.

As the spaceship accelerates in one direction, the kinetic energy of the spaceship increases. This kinetic energy is then transferred to the other half of the fuel, which is being used to brake the spaceship in the opposite direction.

So, in this scenario, the chemical energy of the fuel is being used to accelerate the spaceship in one direction, and then it is being used to brake the spaceship in the opposite direction. This means that the total kinetic energy of the spaceship is still the same, but it is being transferred from one direction to the other.

In essence, the energy that was initially used to accelerate the spaceship is now being used to slow it down. This is a fundamental principle of physics, and it is what allows us to accelerate objects in one direction and then decelerate them in the opposite direction.

It's worth noting that this process is not possible in a vacuum, where there is no external force to slow down the spaceship. However, in a controlled environment or a spacecraft, where there is an external force (such as gravity or a propulsion system) to slow down or speed up the spaceship, this principle applies.<|eot_id|>","This is the [Lorentz force](_URL_0_). It is a force that acts on the spaceship, and it is not a force that is present in the vacuum. This is because the spaceship is moving at a speed that is not zero, and it is not in a vacuum.

If the mass is 10, then it is the gas's mass. In other words, if you have a 1043^6 mass, and you are moving a little faster, you would be moving about 10 times slower than if the speed was 10. But, the same thing holds for a carbon atom. The carbon atoms are not moving as fast as a photon. So, a car with 100 miles on the clock is accelerating at about 2.8 miles per hour. A car moving at a speed of 1,000 miles an hour is going faster than a speeding car at 1.3 miles a hour!the same is true for the carbon molecule. It is doing a lot more than that. A molecule of carbon is at least 5 times more energetic than the car that is traveling at that speed. When the molecules of the two molecules are at the point where they are doing the most work, they will all get the energy that the photon will be able to provide. This is called energy conservation. To make this happen, we need to keep the hydrogen atoms in balance. Since hydrogen is one of a number of gases, it would appear that some of them are going to get more energy if they were to move faster. For example, to make the ""bio-electric"" electrons move, their energy would need 10^{-3} times that of hydrogen. (the ""energy"" of electrons is an equation of energy, or ""dependence""). So a molecule that moves in equilibrium with the electron, will have more electrons than one that does not move. We have to be careful not to over-indulge in energy because that will increase the amount of time the electrons will travel. Therefore, an electron that travels at an energy level that makes the atom move at 5.2 miles/hour would have an 8-hour energy cycle. However, with an extra 10 electrons in its molecule, its energy will only be 8 hours! So we will need an additional 10 molecules to give us an answer to this question. Answer: the atoms of each of these molecules will move with their own energy. Each of those molecules can also be ""coupled"" with another molecule to produce an electric charge. Thus, each molecule is charged when it has the highest energy possible. As the molecule moves, this electric energy is produced by the electric field of its surroundings. An electric current is created when the light inside the vehicle is being converted to electricity. Here is how the electrical current will work: (1) when an atom is ""charged"", it will ""be"" charged by a current, while the current inside it stays at its own current (which is constant). In the first case, there is no current outside the cell, but in this case the charge is kept at 3.5 volts. You can see how this works by looking at this graph:(2) as an example of this, let us look at some electrons that are in charge of an ac motor. They move in ""concentration"". When they do this they create a charge and it can be used to push the motor as it moves. Because of their charge, electrons can move freely. How many electrons does a motor have? The answer is that it only has about 4.6. Note that this is so because the charging current of ac motors is very small. Let us assume that a single electric motor has enough current to run it. That's a 2% charge that can drive a 500-pound truck. Now let's look into the question of how many of our electrons we have. Imagine that you've got a large gas tank filled with gas. Do you want to charge the tank with 5% of your electric power? You don't. Your gas will not do much good. Just as if it had enough hydrogen to fuel the pump, so will the gasoline. At the end of all this gas is stored in your car. What happens to it if we don�t charge it with enough energy to maintain its ""charge""? It will take a while for it to recharge, as the battery will stop working. I�m not sure how long this takes, since i don��t know how to estimate it, although the answer i got is usually a few days. Finally, i would like to mention that there are many different kinds of charges that exist. One charge can only have two electrons, one can have no electrons at all, only one charge at any one time. Another charge has many charges. Some charge seems to have different energy (in the case of electric charges), some charges seem to generate an electrical charge or a magnetic charge (a","~~it is the same as the kinetic energy, but the energy is distributed to the spacecraft.~~ (edit: formatting) this is not the case, the acceleration due to gravity is still the force due the ship. The ""energy"" is transferred to a part of the hull which is where the speed of sound is defined. If the spaceship slows down and the gas in it is less dense, then it will have less kinetic and thus the amount of energy transferred will be lower. This does not happen for a spacecraft traveling at the speeds of light, it does happen if you accelerate the craft and then slow it down, this happens in both cases. So it would be a very small difference in energy. Edit: grammar. I don't think it's true that the two parts of a ship can be separated from each other and that they are moving at speeds greater than the velocity of that. As you know, in vacuum the difference between the engines is negligible. But in space, say, a space ship the thrust of one part is equivalent to its weight, and a shuttle is equal to it mass, so if two pieces of space ships are separated, they will still have the exact same thrust. And same speed. At a high speeds, there is no difference. That is what you have to do with thrust, for, gravity. Also, if something like a rocket engines, which can travel at c=c=k, you can't be travelling atk and c. They don’t have exactly the equivalent. In, an object moving faster than c, or c is going faster. It‘t be moving with, c =k. Just like the total mass. You“then, atc. Or, that”the speed, being equal.

"If gravity is the effect of space-time being stretched, wouldn't an object's angular momentum generate gravitational effects?","Yes. This is mainly a thing for spinning black holes, although the gravitational effects of the Earth's rotation has been measured by a very precise satellite experiment called [Gravity Probe B](_URL_0_). However, this isn't the reason for prograde orbits, that more has to do with angular momentum conservation and the initial conditions of planetary systems.","Yes, an object's angular momentum can indeed generate gravitational effects. However, the relationship between angular momentum and gravity is more complex than a simple ""angular momentum generates gravity.""

Angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating or revolving around a central point. It depends on the object's mass, radius, and velocity. The formula for angular momentum is:

L = Iω

where L is the angular momentum, I is the moment of inertia (a measure of an object's mass distribution), and ω is the angular velocity.

Now, when an object has a significant amount of angular momentum, it can generate a gravitational effect on nearby objects. This is known as an ""angular momentum-driven gravitational effect.""

However, there are some key points to consider:

1. **Angular momentum is not a direct effect**: Angular momentum is a separate property of an object that doesn't directly generate gravity. Gravity is a separate force that acts between objects with mass.
2. **Angular momentum is a conservative force**: The angular momentum of an object is a conservative force, which means it's a force that depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken.
3. **Gravity is a non-conservative force**: Gravity is a non-conservative force, which means it's not a force that depends only on the initial and final states of the system. Gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved, their velocity, and the distance between them.

In other words, while angular momentum can generate a gravitational effect, it's not the same as saying that gravity is a result of an object's angular momentum. Gravity is a separate force that's a fundamental aspect of the universe, and it's not directly dependent on angular momentum.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Imagine a spinning top. When it's spinning, it has a lot of angular momentum. If you were to measure the gravitational effect on the spinning top, you'd find that it's actually a very small effect, almost imperceptible. This is because the gravitational effect is a result of the spinning top's motion, not its angular momentum.

In summary, while angular momentum can generate a gravitational effect, it's not a direct effect. Gravity is a separate force that's a fundamental aspect of the universe, and it's not directly dependent on angular momentum.<|eot_id|>","> I'm guessing that the angular momentum of an object would generate a gravitational effect, because angular momentum is a vector quantity. It does, but it's not exactly what you think it is. The object will generate a gravitational field, but it's not just the angular momentum that does this. The angular momentum of a rotating object generates a gravitational field, and this is what we call the [gravitomagnetic effect](_URL_0_). The angular momentum of a non-rotating object doesn't generate a gravitational field. In fact, the gravitational field generated by a non-rotating object is zero. So, to answer your question, no, an object's angular momentum does not generate a gravitational field.<|eot_id|>","I think it's possible. The most common example of this is in the case of the moon, which has a mass of about one-half that of earth. When the moon's gravity pulls in on itself, the gravitational force on the earth is about 1.8x10-11, and that force is applied to the planet in an acceleration-like way. As the gravity and momentum of gravity move through the atmosphere, they compress and compress the entire planet. As they cool and cool, their energy is transferred to and from the sun. This is called ""gravity dissipation"", and it causes the motion of objects to be shifted around and back to their original position. In the diagram below, we see that the rotation of a planet is reversed when the orbital motion is taken into account. The planet's gravitational pull is increased when it is pushed back toward the sun. So the force of centrifugal force, called gravitational acceleration, is 1,8.6x11.5x9.2x8 . This means that if the pressure on earth on a very cold planet (like the one on which we live) is reduced by 1 , the mass on earth is shifted to 1 . __________now, as we can see, there are a lot of different ways in which the forces of motion on our planet are applied. In the diagrams below we have a list of these different possible actions. We can imagine that we are standing in front of an enormous screen with a large screen facing right. On it there is a small screen that has an axis of rotation (a. K. A., the point where the screen is facing the center of mass). The screen has no position or rotation. It is not in any way moving. When we move it, it does not move in a straight line. Instead, when we rotate it around, its position is changed by a series of changes. What we do is change the position of its screen. If we tilt the small-screen down a certain way, then we change its orientation. However, if we want to change it to a different orientation, our screen will not rotate. But if, for some reason, something is happening on that screen, that is, a change in its rotation, or even if it changes its form, what we need to do to make it move. Now, i will explain this problem in more detail. First, let's start with the change of orientation of our small screens. I'm going to start off by saying that in order to move the big screen around on its axis, you must first move its display, so that it moves in that direction. Then, after the first rotation the display will rotate, not the other way around. Since the orientation is different on each screen in relation to one another, this means we must change our display to rotate one way or the next. To do this, simply move your small display in different directions. And this will change your screen's orientation with each rotation by one, depending on how much you want it rotated. Note that each of my examples is only one of many possible ways to create a screen rotation that affects its motion. Each of those can be done by simply moving the whole screen of your system. Also, to see how i would do it (and what i know of how it works), just move one or more of them around the system by pressing the move button. Finally, here's the problem. Suppose that you are going in one direction, but you're going out the opposite direction on one screen (or in some other direction). You're in two directions, both of which are rotating at different times. You can either go in either direction or out of both directions by moving your large display. At this point, your display is moving from left to right, from right to left, moving up and down, etc. Your screen moves from a horizontal plane to an angle of 90 degrees. There's a whole range of possible changes to your image, including: changing the size of each pixel. Changing the color of all the pixels. Changing how the brightness of certain parts of that image changes with respect to other pixels (e. G., changing its brightness when viewing a picture of someone in his right hand, because he has trouble with white balance on his screen). Changing whether a specific color is on or off the background of any of his or her images (the color in question, ""black""). Changing whether the pixel on your main screen or on an adjacent screen reflects that color. Turning off your camera. Turning off any other feature that your phone or tablet is capable of (such as the camera). Or turning on any feature or feature on another device (i. E., a battery, flash, monitor, screen reader). Changing which other screen you will use. And how to set up your tablet, while you can. All of it","~~if you mean an effect caused by the expansion of the universe, then no. There's no such thing as an ""inertial mass"" and no ""rotational mass"". However, the forces acting on objects are the same, and they are related. The force of gravity acting upon an atom or molecule is proportional to its angular velocity. This is why a ball on a string is heavier than a basketball.~~ the earth is rotating about its axis of rotation. So if you put a bowling ball in the middle of a rotating earth, it will be rotating at an angle of 1.5 degrees to the axis. That's because the bowling balls have an angular mass of about 0.1 g. If the ball were to be on the surface of an earth-like planet, this would be 0 g, but it would still be very small. On earth this will result in an ellipse, which is a circle that is slightly wider than the diameter of earth. A planet rotating around a star would have a diameter larger elliptical orbit, because that would result from the rotation of its core. (note that this doesn't actually happen on this planet because it's rotating, as it rotates around the center of mass.) so it wouldn’t generate any gravitational forces, just the opposite force from gravity. Edit: thanks for the correction. Also, gravity isn‘t just an inverse square law. It“s the inverse of force, not the square of distance, so gravity, that” gravity doesn‖ is an extra. You‥ force. Gravity does not. I think gravity— gravity = force x distance. Just a force that isn't a result of angular distance^2 force is square. Distance (square distance1, or forcex. Its the distance squared. Therefore it is just volume. Sorry i guess i assume it isnd be gravity and distance2. And the answer to your question is ""wouldn‗ gravity in terms of gravitational force... If it were the sum of all the masses and angular velocities of things. What is gravity? Gravity(0.01 g and gravity^(2) = distance(g^3) and radius^0/2 . Edit 2, i don‚r.0=g2, in units of diameter. Source: this isnt. Answer for this, if we assume gravity exists. Yes, yes. But the gravity of that exists is not angular. For all gravity (1.6.3 g^r . It could be 2^(-1) or gravity on its radius. To rotate around an equal to radius, radius of 2. Which it also has a radius (2/3). Gravity at all times the radius 2 . This force can be divided by (g/r) in g . If 2 times radius to get a point. Since its distance is 2g. In this case it has units, 2 g3 = (0,2 ). So the ratio of g2=1/g3. Not radius and so yes there is angular acceleration (or angular force (this is also the number of acceleration) is equal and vice versa. 2 gravity as well. No force and yes it might not be mass. Now gravity also be the difference in a vector. Is something like distance or angular gravity from earth and time. As far as we know gravity will never be equal. Or opposite gravity=0 the mean. We are not equal in all directions. Hence it doesnt happen in our orbits. Hope that you get that gravity gets the way. G is in coordinates of equal distance as a function of time, where it does. E=m and velocity is positive. However it only. _url_ is negative. Thats just distance that. Here is what it means, g(1 if its a constant. **distance.

Why do we have fingernails?,"Primates have fingernails because we like to pick up tiny things - bugs, sticks, fruits, etc. - without damaging them. Having claws is good for grabbing big stuff that will run away if you don't stab them with claws. Claws are generally big bulky things that are used like forks. Evolution-wise, there are some mighty tasty bugs and stuff that you need to have small fingers for. Ever seen women with big fake fingernails on? They can't do shit. Fingernails are out of the way enough for us to use our fingertips for small stuff. We still have them because we haven't really had much of a reason to get rid of them, and I think they might act as ""bumpers,"" as well - we can scratch stuff, scrape stuff, bump our fingers into things to feel them without hurting ourselves too badly, etc.","Fingernails serve several important functions in the human body. Here are some reasons why we have fingernails:

1. **Protection**: Fingernails act as a barrier to protect the sensitive tips of our fingers and toes from friction, abrasion, and other external forces. They help prevent injuries and damage to the skin.

2. **Sensation**: Fingernails contain sensory nerve endings, which allow us to feel touch, pressure, and vibrations. This helps us to navigate and interact with our environment.

3. **Support**: The fingernails provide structural support to the fingers and toes, allowing them to flex and move. The nails are attached to the underlying bone and connective tissue, providing a stable framework.

4. **Cuticle maintenance**: The nail plate is a part of the cuticle, a thin layer of skin that covers the base of the fingernails or toenails. Keeping the cuticle clean and moisturized helps to prevent irritation and infection.

5. **Deterioration prevention**: The nail plate helps to prevent the nail from lifting off the nail bed. This helps to prevent nail plate from becoming brittle and breaking.

6. **Evolutionary significance**: Fingernails have been a part of human anatomy for millions of years. They have evolved to serve specific functions and have been an essential part of human development.

Overall, fingernails are an essential part of human anatomy, providing protection, sensation, support, and other vital functions.<|eot_id|>","We don't. The nails we have are actually called ""phalanges"", and they are the long, thin bones in the fingers and toes. The phalanges are a result of our ancestors having the ability to grasp things, such as rocks, and holding onto them with their nails. It's not that we have nails, it's that our nails are actually the remnants of our ancestors' nails.  It's also worth noting that we don't have fingernails, we have fingernails.  I've been a dentist for 20 years, and I've never had to deal with fingernails, so I can tell you that the nails on our hands are actually very important. If they were gone, we would have to rely on the other parts of our hands to hold onto things, and that would be a big problem.<|eot_id|>","I think the reason is that i've always been fascinated with the human hand, and i think that the fingering of nails is a bit of a mystery. I know that fingers are a very delicate instrument, but i just don't think it's something that you can just grab and throw around and not be able to do it. You can hold a nail in your hand and you don, you know, it will go into your palm, which is really something. You may not think about fingered nails at all, because there are no nail-free items. But if you're like me and want to try something out and see if it works, just ask someone in the general public, so i can see what you think.","Ive always wondered why we don't have nails. I have a guess that it is because our ancestors had them long enough to live on their fingers and nails, so they are less likely to die of natural causes, such as infection or tooth decay. Nails have been used for a long time, and they were used as tools in our early ancestors. The fingering is just a way of removing the skin, the way we do with the fingers today. It may not be a reason to have them for everyday life, but it's something we've been doing for thousands of years.

How does the nuclear missle defence work?,"No.  Modern nuclear weapons require a very precise series of timed explosions take place to compress the fissile material and produce a nuclear explosion. An incoming warhead struck by an interceptor missile would not detonate. It would be forcefully torn apart by the impact, and scattered over a relatively wide area in likely very small pieces. The actual amount of nuclear material in a warhead is fairly small, and the resulting contamination would be minimal.","The nuclear missile defense (NMD) system is designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles (BM) in the atmosphere, using a combination of technologies. Here's an overview of the key components and their functions:

1. **Early Warning System (EWS)**: The EWS is the first line of defense. It consists of radar and satellite systems that detect the presence of a BM and track its trajectory. The EWS provides early warning of the missile's approach, allowing for timely detection and reporting to the NMD center.
2. **Interceptors**: The NMD system consists of a fleet of interceptors, including:
	* **Ground-based interceptors (GBIs)**: These are the largest and most powerful interceptors, which use a combination of radar and infrared sensors to track and engage the missile.
	* **Airborne interceptors**: These are smaller and lighter interceptors, which use radar and infrared sensors to detect the missile and engage it with missiles or other interceptors.
	* **Space-based interceptors**: These are satellites that use advanced sensors to track the missile and engage it with interceptors or other systems.
3. **Engagement**: Once the missile is detected, the interceptor engages it using a variety of methods, including:
	* **Kinetic energy penetrators**: These are small missiles that are launched from the interceptor to destroy the missile.
	* **Harpoon missiles**: These are anti-ship missiles that are used to engage the missile.
	* **Electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)**: These are used to disable the missile's guidance systems.
4. **Neutralization**: Once the missile is engaged, the interceptor neutralizes it by destroying its guidance systems and propulsion systems.
5. **Post-interception**: After the missile is neutralized, the interceptor provides real-time data to the NMD center, which uses this information to determine the missile's final trajectory and determine its fate.

The NMD system also includes:

* **Command and Control (C2) systems**: These are the systems that control and coordinate the NMD system, including the EWS, interceptors, and C2 centers.
* **Communications systems**: These are used to transmit data between the EWS, interceptors, and C2 centers.
* **Maintenance and Repair (M&R) facilities**: These are used to maintain and repair the interceptors and other NMD systems.

The NMD system is designed to provide a layered defense against ballistic missiles, using a combination of technologies to detect, engage, and neutral","The missiles are equipped with a small nuclear warhead.

Question: what is your opinion of what the ""missle"" is?answer: the missl is an alternative to the trident missile system. I do not agree with the fact that it would be good for scotland but i think that the issue is that there is no way for it to go through the defence system without the support of other parts of britain. There is also no alternative. This is because there would have to be a large amount of money involved to do it. The cost of it has to come from other sources. I am not saying that scotland is in any way better off. But i believe that if it were to get through with it, it could be done. And that is what i want to see. It could take a lot of time, and it should be on the basis of a long-term programme. If it was to have a short-lived programme, then it might be time for a new one. Question: can you give an example of an ""unsubmerged nuclear fuel"" in the united kingdom? Answer: no. No, that would not be very helpful. However, i have seen a couple of examples of ""unsung"" nuclear power plants being built in scotland in recent years. What about the u-235 nuclear reactor in glasgow that i described above? Answer : the current uk nuclear weapons program is based on a single, unsubmersed reactor. In the us, a larger, more complex nuclear plant would produce more nuclear energy than would a smaller one, such as a nuclear submarine. We would also have more plutonium, which would then be produced by the more sophisticated plutonium reactor, called the tungsten reactor. That is, the reactor would contain more uranium than is currently produced. So the idea is to build a more powerful reactor than what we currently have. Now, when we consider that nuclear plants can produce plutonium more efficiently than they can make nuclear bombs, this idea would make sense. (i have never heard of that idea, although i suspect that you might. )in any case, you would need to consider how much plutonium you have, what kind of fuel you are using, how many people you're using and how long you've been using it . What's the best way to make a bomb that produces plutonium? How much fuel can we use? Answer i don't know. My guess is about 0.4 liters, or 0/30,000, for each kilogram of plutonium. You can put the amount in a gallon of water and drink it in about 12 minutes. Let me go back to what you said about how fast you can do that. Is it really possible to produce a plutonium bomb of about 100-150 kg? What is it about that that makes it possible? The answer is yes. Your answer to that question is very simple. On the one hand, if you want your bomb to work, its fuel needs to burn at about 3-4 times its own fuel. At this point, your fuel is much more expensive than the fuel of your target, because it needs more fuel to move about and to reach the target. As long as your reactor has sufficient fuel, there will be no problems. For a given amount, however, some of its energy needs will not change. Therefore, even if your nuclear weapon does not produce enough plutonium to meet the needs of our target population, we can still use it as fuel if the need arises. All this means that we will have enough fuel and can use the plutonium as needed. Here is my answer for you. You might say that, on average, about 15% of all the energy in an unsupervised nuclear test is spent fuel (or fuel that has been removed from the test reactor and stored at the site). So we are talking about a ""very high energy level"" of energy. Which means, from a fuel point of view, very high amounts of spent energy (such as the spent nuclear waste that can actually be generated by a test). However this does mean that a high amount (and this is assuming that your test will produce any waste at all) of these spent-energy spent will go to waste. Not only is this a problem, not only will waste be wasted, of course, as you will see later on. Nuclear waste is produced from nuclear reactors that have been designed to operate at a constant power level. They are designed for continuous operation. When you build one of those reactors, one day you'll have spent spent reactor fuel stored in your tank, ready to use by then. Well, by that time you may have already produced a waste product. Thus, waste from that day","~~the missles' warheads are constantly in motion in the air. They also use a special, but still powerful, thruster to pull the warheads out of the way.~~ edit: i should add that the misslem system doesn't really work like a missile. It uses a rotating cannon that spins around and shoots the missile at the target, and then uses the thrusters to spin around it and shoot it back at it. The missiles are moving at a different speed than the cannon, so the spinning is not as effective. _____ edit 2: the reason for the spin is because the fission of a nuclear weapon requires a lot of energy. So in order to get a fissile material to a target it needs to be moving fast enough that it can keep spinning for long enough to destroy the object. If you want to use the same weapon for a long time and get it to break, you'd need to constantly spin the weapon. Edit 3: [this](_url_0_) is a good summary of how the sr-71 works.

How come humans get grossed out by odors while animals don't?,"Animals also get “grossed out” by certain orders. Cats aren’t very fond of vinegar for example. The difference in us and them is they aren’t as dramatic as “we” are. They don’t like a smell, they will shy away from it. “We” have too make it known it’s not a pleasant odor. I think in part it is a way we communicate information. It also could be a way for us too gain validation of our senses... “if it smells bad to me, it must smell bad to you...right?”","Humans get grossed out by odors due to a combination of factors, including:

1. **Evolutionary adaptations**: Our ancestors developed a strong sense of smell to detect potential threats, such as predators, competitors, or mates. This led to the evolution of a highly sensitive olfactory system. Over time, our brains became attuned to detect even the faintest of smells, making us more sensitive to odors.
2. **Olfactory receptors**: Our noses contain specialized cells called olfactory receptors, which bind to odor molecules and trigger a response in the brain. These receptors are highly sensitive to certain smells, allowing us to detect even the smallest amounts.
3. **Brain processing**: When we detect an odor, our brains process it quickly and send signals to the brain's reward centers, which release dopamine and other neurotransmitters. This creates a strong association between the odor and the experience of pleasure, which can make us more sensitive to odors.
4. **Conditioned response**: Our brains have learned to associate certain smells with specific events, such as food, hygiene, or stress. This is known as a conditioned response. When we smell something unpleasant, our brains recall the experience of smelling something unpleasant in the past and link it to the current odor.
5. **Neurotransmitters**: The release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, plays a crucial role in our response to odors. These chemicals help regulate the intensity and duration of our response to odors.

Animals, on the other hand, have a different olfactory system that is less sensitive and less complex. They do not have the same level of olfactory receptors or the same brain processing mechanisms as humans. As a result, they are less sensitive to odors and do not get grossed out by the same smells.

Some key differences between human and animal olfaction include:

* **Smell threshold**: Animals have a higher smell threshold than humans, meaning they can detect even fainter smells.
* **Olfactory receptors**: Animals have fewer olfactory receptors than humans, which reduces their sensitivity to certain smells.
* **Brain processing**: Animals have a different brain processing mechanism that is less sensitive to odors.
* **Conditioned response**: Animals do not have the same conditioned response to odors as humans, which means they do not associate certain smells with specific events.

These differences are thought to have evolved over time to help animals detect and respond to their environment in a more efficient and effective way.<|eot_id|>","Humans get grossed out by odors because our brains are designed to be sensitive to smells. Smells are a very important part of our survival. They are used to locate food, to avoid predators, to find mates, etc. Smells are also used to warn us of danger.  Animals do not have the same level of smell sensitivity.  Smell is a very important part of our survival, but it's not necessary for all species. Some animals do not have the necessary smell sensitivity, but they still have other senses that help them survive.  For example, many birds are able to fly, but they cannot smell.  Many animals are able to run, but they cannot smell.  Many animals are able to swim, but they cannot smell.  So, when animals are able to smell, they are able to find food and avoid danger, but when humans are able to smell, we are able to find food and avoid danger.<|eot_id|>","I'm not sure what the answer is, but i've read that humans have an extremely poor sense of smell. I don, however, think that we are the only species in the world that has an ability to smell things. I think there are many other animals that can smell, which is why we have the ability for it to be so common. If you look at the list of animals which are ""obvious"" to humans, i'd suggest that they are:carpal sparrows (carcharodon sp.)dinosaurus (deinonyx)giant spiders (gephytus)kairosaurus (scythe) __________________ last edited by lgolaf; 04-08-2009 at 11:46 am .","~~humans get very dry noses.~~ animals get really dry. Edit: a lot of animals have a really good sense of smell. For example, i would say that we have the best sense for when we smell things. If you've ever been in a car, you know that smell is coming from your nose. But we don’t, because we aren‘t used to it. And we are not used as much. So we get the smell of the car instead. This is why dogs and cats are often more sensitive to odours. Dogs can smell the odour of a dog even if it is not their own. They have evolved to be sensitive when smelling things that are their scent, and this allows them to smell for themselves. Cats can also smell their food, but they are more used for food. I think i“m wrong. Source: i worked as a vet and have been a veterinary technician for a long time.

How will the increased interest rates by the Federal Reserve affect consumers?,"To the average person, you might see your rates go up a slight bit, or banks might be less willing to create new loans. On a broad scale, the Federal Reserve loans money out to the big banks, who in turn loan it out to smaller banks, businesses, and people.  By raising the interest rate, the Fed is making it more expensive to borrow money from them.","Increased interest rates by the Federal Reserve can have various effects on consumers, including:

1. **Higher mortgage rates**: With higher interest rates, mortgage rates will rise, making it more expensive for consumers to buy or refinance a home. This can lead to reduced demand for housing, potentially affecting housing markets.
2. **Increased car loan rates**: Higher interest rates can lead to higher car loan rates, making it more expensive for consumers to finance their vehicles. This can lead to reduced demand for cars and affect the automotive industry.
3. **Higher credit card rates**: With higher interest rates, credit card rates will rise, making it more expensive for consumers to carry credit card debt. This can lead to reduced demand for credit cards and affect the credit card industry.
4. **Increased student loan rates**: Higher interest rates can lead to higher student loan rates, making it more expensive for consumers to borrow money for education. This can affect the higher education sector.
5. **Reduced credit availability**: Higher interest rates can lead to reduced credit availability, making it more difficult for consumers to access credit. This can affect the broader economy, as consumers may delay purchases or investments due to higher interest rates.
6. **Increased costs for consumers**: Higher interest rates can lead to increased costs for consumers in various areas, such as:
    * Higher utility bills (electricity, water, gas)
    * Higher insurance premiums (health, auto, home)
    * Higher healthcare costs (medical bills)
    * Higher food prices (groceries)
7. **Reduced economic growth**: Higher interest rates can lead to reduced economic growth, as consumers may delay purchases or investments due to higher interest rates. This can affect the overall economy, as reduced spending can lead to lower economic growth.

To mitigate these effects, the Federal Reserve may take measures such as:

1. **Interest rate cuts**: Lowering interest rates can help stimulate economic growth and reduce the effects of higher interest rates.
2. **Monetary policy adjustments**: The Federal Reserve may adjust its monetary policy to counteract the effects of higher interest rates.
3. **Quantitative easing**: The Federal Reserve may engage in quantitative easing to inject liquidity into the economy and reduce interest rates.

It is essential to note that the effects of higher interest rates on consumers will vary depending on the specific market and sector.<|eot_id|>","The interest rates are going to be higher than they have been for the past few years. The Federal Reserve has been doing this in an effort to help the economy recover from the housing bubble bursting. When the housing bubble burst, it caused a lot of people to stop buying homes and stop spending money on cars. This caused a lot of people to lose their jobs and had a big effect on the economy. The Federal Reserve has been trying to get the economy back on track by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. The interest rates are going to be higher than they have been for the past few years. This will cause a lot of people to lose their jobs and have a big effect on the economy.<|eot_id|>","This is the question we ask ourselves in our daily lives. We have seen the federal reserve raise interest rate expectations by a small amount and the fed's move to raise rates has been a big one. It's a little bit of a stretch to say that the government will be able to do a better job of keeping inflation low than it would be without the increase in the reserve. The fact that government is raising rates because of interest payments on government bonds is an indication of the extent to which the dollar is a reserve currency. In other words, if the treasury is willing to lower rates, it will have to take out more money to keep inflation in check. The fed will also have the ability to borrow more to pay for inflation, which will make it harder for government to run deficits. In other word, government spending will increase and inflation will rise. If the reserve were to hike rates at the same rate as the private sector, the economy would grow at an even faster rate. This would have a negative impact on the u. S. Economy, because the total value of government assets would decrease.","Ianas, i'm a former bank manager and i have a hard time finding a single reason why the interest rate will increase, and the reason i can't seem to find a reason it doesn't. I think the issue is that the fed has been making a huge amount of money, so the banks have been doing a lot of business. If the rates go up, it's going to be a combination of a) the economy is getting worse, b) interest is going up. It'll be very hard for the government to keep up with the inflation, because the money will be tied up in bonds. The idea of the ""interest rate hike"" is to make sure the markets can keep inflation low. This is very important, as it means that if you're buying a house for $500,000, the price of your house will go down. You can also buy a car for just $300, if your car is worth $350, you'll have to pay a higher interest penalty. So it will take a while for people to adjust to the new rates. People will also start to think that they're paying more to buy houses, but it won't happen until they actually pay their new rate. Since they are paying less. Tl;dr: the current rate is the rate they set, they'll keep it higher. Edit: and it was a little bit of an estimate of what they were looking for.

"How big is the Earth, as seen from the sun?",About 17 arc seconds. This is similar to the size that Mars appears from Earth.,"As seen from the Sun, the Earth appears to be about 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) in diameter. This is because the Sun is much larger than the Earth, and its light appears to be much brighter than the Earth's. This is known as the ""apparent size"" of the Earth.

To put this in perspective, if the Sun were the size of the Moon, the Earth would appear to be about 1/4 of a mile (400 meters) in diameter. This is why astronomers use the ""apparent size"" of the Earth to calculate its distance from the Sun.

It's worth noting that this apparent size is not the same as the actual size of the Earth. The actual diameter of the Earth is about 7,918 miles (12,742 kilometers). However, due to the way light travels, the Earth appears to be about 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) in diameter when viewed from the Sun.<|eot_id|>","You are correct that the Earth is about 40,000 km in diameter. However, the Sun is about 109 times larger than the Earth. So, from the Sun's perspective, the Earth is a tiny little dot. This is a common misconception, because the Sun is so massive. The Sun is actually about 109 times more massive than the Earth. But from the Earth's perspective, the Sun is about 1/1000 of the size of the Earth.<|eot_id|>","A hugecircle is visible from all directions. The ices of the earth are iced up .

That's a lot of volume for an object like the moon. The outer planets are about 4x the mass of earth. So, for comparison, the total volume is about 7x11^-12 cubic meters. _url_0_ _u/georgy_k_zhukov explains further in this thread. As for the size of a planet, kerkshaw says it would have to be around 1/10th the diameter of our sun, so it's about the same size as the mars moon, but much smaller. This means that it'd be about 2x as massive as mars, and about 5x that much larger than earth's moon (which is roughly 2.5x larger). The planet would weigh about 12x heavier than mars (so about 0.2x our moon). So for a typical sized planet (about 7,000, 000,0000, which is 0x earth), it weighs about 11x more than the other planets in the entire solar neighborhood. Edit: corrected for volume.

Why is it so easy for some people to wake up and be productive immediately while others remain groggy for hours?,I encourage you to check out this youtube video _URL_0_ Explains it better than I can,"There are several factors that can contribute to the difference in productivity levels between individuals. Here are some possible reasons:

1. **Sleep Quality and Duration**: People who sleep well and for longer periods tend to have better sleep quality and duration. This means they are more likely to wake up feeling refreshed and alert.
2. **Sleep Cycles**: Research suggests that people tend to experience a more regular sleep pattern, with fewer sleep cycles. This can lead to better sleep quality and a more restorative sleep environment.
3. **Circadian Rhythm**: People with a more regular circadian rhythm tend to feel more alert and productive during the day. This is because their bodies are naturally more alert in the morning and more tired at night.
4. **Morning Routine**: People who establish a consistent morning routine tend to feel more alert and productive. This can include activities like exercise, meditation, or a healthy breakfast.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: People who engage in regular physical activity, eat a balanced diet, and limit screen time tend to have better sleep quality and a more regular sleep schedule.
6. **Genetic Factors**: Some people may be naturally more alert and productive due to their genetic makeup.
7. **Brain Chemistry**: Research suggests that people with a more efficient brain chemistry tend to be more alert and productive. This can be influenced by factors like neurotransmitters, hormones, and brain wave activity.

On the other hand, people who remain groggy for hours may be experiencing:

1. **Sleep Deprivation**: Lack of sufficient sleep can lead to fatigue, grogginess, and decreased productivity.
2. **Poor Sleep Quality**: Irregular sleep patterns, sleep disruptions, or poor sleep quality can make it difficult to wake up and feel alert.
3. **Disrupted Circadian Rhythm**: Irregular sleep schedules or sleep disruptions can confuse the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to grogginess.
4. **Circadian Rhythm Imbalance**: Some people may have an imbalance in their circadian rhythm, leading to difficulty waking up and feeling alert.

To improve your productivity, consider the following:

1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine.
2. Engage in regular physical activity and a balanced diet.
3. Practice good sleep hygiene and limit screen time before bedtime.
4. Develop a morning routine that sets a positive tone for the day.
5. Get enough sleep each night and take breaks to rest and recharge.

Remember, everyone's sleep needs and patterns are unique, and it's essential to listen","I've had this happen to me before. I'm a bit of an oddball, but I'm a ""morning person."" I get up at 6:00 and am ready to go by 8:00. I have a few hours to get my brain going, and I spend that time reading, journaling, and doing other stuff that I enjoy. Then, at 8:00, I'm ready to go, and I'm out the door.  Now, I'm not saying that I'm the only ""morning person."" My wife is a ""morning person"" too, but she's a ""morning person"" who also likes to spend a few hours in the morning reading, journaling, and doing other stuff. I think the difference is that I'm a ""morning person"" who also likes to do stuff in the morning, but I also have a lot of other stuff to do in the morning. I'm not just ""morning person"" who likes to sleep in. I'm not a ""morning person"" who just likes to sleep in.<|eot_id|>","This is why i am writing this. I have been writing about productivity since 2008 and i have written about my productivity for over ten years. I love it. In my previous blog post i talked about the benefits of being able to focus on your task at any time and that i do not think this is the case for most people. However, i think there are a few things that people need to know about how to get productivity up. They need some context. The first is that most productivity is achieved by the individual. We all have a finite amount of time to work. As a result, it is very easy to not get any work done. This is a fundamental aspect of productivity. What i mean by this, is this: if you are able, then you can work on whatever you want and keep up to date with your work and your goals. If you do nothing at all, you will probably never be able or able not to be creative. It is extremely important to keep your focus and motivation up in order to stay on top of your activity. So, what i'm saying is, if i work as hard as i can, that will make me happier and make my work more productive. But, when i start working, my focus is on my task, not my time. When i get up from my desk, and my activity is up, the focus will be on the task and not on what it's doing. The more time i spend on this task the more productivity i will get. There is some advice that some folks might like to read but i feel that this does not apply to everyone. There are many different things you could do to increase productivity, but you should always be prepared to spend some time in the morning. After all you don't have to write a book to do this and it will help you get the most out of the day. In fact, for many people, after a day of work, they might want to go back and check on their progress. A good start would be to take a break, like a nap, or just be a little more relaxed. Instead of just sitting and doing nothing, take your time, work hard, focus, be more focused and have fun. You'll get more of what you need. And if your goal is to create a better day, try to enjoy your day and get some more sleep. Or, as a more creative person, start using more fun things to make your life easier. To summarize, just as it takes time for the brain to develop new neurons and to learn new ways of thinking, so too do it take time before the mind can learn to produce new ones. I believe that the main reason we are not able for a lot of people is because we can't get enough of our own time (and it may be time we could be better at it). It may take some effort to try and do something to add to your productivity as long as you keep it up at the same time as your brain is developing new neural connections. My experience is most of us don`t really think about what we do for our time or what things we want or need as important as our productivity when we have it, instead we focus our attention on other things like how much time it took me to finish my book, how many hours i spent on it or how long i was doing it on time so i could keep working on that task. Once you start getting this idea, make sure you have some kind of plan to help your mind get used to the idea and then work towards it as soon as possible. Take a look at my recent blog posts for an example of how i try my best to give my brain time not only to think, to remember, learn and work but to use it to solve problems. (i love to share my thoughts on life and how it works and what to say to my friends and family). One thing i really like about this article is i dont have any problem with it at this point. People will often tell me that it has helped me with my writing and writing is one of my greatest strengths. Even though i usually dont talk about it too much, let me tell you that there is an important difference between me and other people who are trying to fix their writing problems with writing exercises. On the one hand, most writers are good at writing. Not only are they good with the writing, their technique is also very good. Writing is not a skill that a professional can teach them. No one can improve their ability to edit or edit text on a computer. While they can get a sense of a writer's strengths, there can also be some problems that can arise when they are writing a problem. One of those problems is how they write. Some writers don�t even understand how writing works, even though it can be done","~~i'm not sure if it's the same for everybody, but i've always heard that if you sleep more than once, you'll wake more often.~~ edit: it may be that you don't sleep as much after a night of sleep and you're waking up in the middle of the night and not having a productive night. I don’t know, i‘m not a doctor or anything. It sounds like you might have a lot more to do with sleeping than your waking hours. Edit 2: i was not clear, so i just made a correction. [here's a link to a study that showed sleeping more may have an effect on sleep quality.](_url_0_) edit 3: [this is a good review of this effect.] (_url._1_ ) the link is good, and the conclusion is that there is an inverse relationship between sleep duration and quality of life. So if your sleep is shorter than a certain amount, your quality-of-life will be better. If, however, the amount of time you spend sleeping is longer than the number of hours you spent sleeping, then your productivity will drop. You could say that your performance on the task may actually be worse. The shortness of your life will also drop, because of how much you slept more. Or how long you have slept than you've slept.

Why does the Government keep trying to pass CISA if they know no one wants it?,"""no one wants it"" is completely wrong. the people bankrolling elections and the government want it for sure. Its a very effective way for cable and internet companies to make more money, so they're trying their hardest to pass it.  As another poster said, laws arent always made for the ""regular joe""","It seems like you're referring to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The U.S. government's efforts to pass CISA are indeed puzzling, given that the agency has not yet been enacted into law.

There are several reasons why the government might be pushing for CISA:

1. **National Security**: CISA is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for securing the country's critical infrastructure, including the Internet of Things (IoT), networks, and other sensitive systems. By creating a dedicated agency, the government can ensure that these systems are better protected against cyber threats.

2. **Cybersecurity Cooperation**: CISA is also intended to facilitate international cooperation and information sharing among nations. By creating a single, unified framework for cybersecurity, the government can help other countries better protect themselves against cyber threats.

3. **Cybersecurity Threats**: The government acknowledges that there are significant cybersecurity threats facing the country, including the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cyber realm, and the growing threat of nation-state actors.

4. **Legislative History**: The creation of CISA is not a new idea. The National Security Agency (NSA) was created in 1952, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was first proposed in 2014. There is a historical precedent for the creation of such an agency, which suggests that the government is aware of its importance.

5. **Partisan Politics**: Unfortunately, the creation of CISA is not without controversy. Some politicians have expressed concerns that the agency will be too centralized or that it will not be sufficient to protect the country's critical infrastructure.

It's worth noting that the creation of CISA is a complex and multifaceted process. It requires significant legislative and regulatory changes, as well as coordination with various government agencies, industry stakeholders, and international partners.

In summary, the government's efforts to pass CISA are likely driven by a combination of national security concerns, the need for international cooperation, the threat of significant cybersecurity threats, and a desire to create a unified framework for cybersecurity protection.<|eot_id|>","Because it's a government bill, not a private company bill. Government bills are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as private companies bills.  There's a lot of people who are against it, but it's not as widespread as you think.  There are also a lot of people who think that it's a good idea, and that it will help the US in some way.  And, there are people who think that it's a good idea, and that it will help the US in some way, but they don't want to be responsible for it. So, there's a lot of people on both sides of the issue, and a lot of people who don't think it's a good idea.  If it were a private company, there would be a lot more people who don't think it's a good idea, but it would be subject to the same level of scrutiny as private companies.  That's not the case with the government, so they have a lot more freedom to do what they want.<|eot_id|>","They want to get rid of the ciphers and add them to the list of things that can be done to ""protect"" privacy.

He was convicted of violating the law and the us supreme court ruled in 2014 that he violated the constitution. Ians lao was arrested, charged with embezzlement and sentenced to 3 years in jail. The supreme courts ruled that ia was not violating any of the laws that the united states has enacted. I believe that this ruling is the reason why the president has tried to get congress to veto the bill. This is a very powerful move. Congress is basically a rubber stamp for the executive branch. They are not allowed to do anything they think would be politically good. There are people who are trying, but they have not been able to bring a bill to the floor for a while. So they can't pass it. If congress does pass a law, they will have to vote to approve it, and then the senate will vote on it as well. Most of their votes are for things like raising the minimum wage, raising medicare, or lowering taxes. When they pass the bills, the people that have the votes to support the legislation won't have enough of a majority to overturn it to override the veto it and pass them. Edit: spelling.

Bayonet charges vs bayonet *battles*,"During the Battle of Borodino, the Russians set up several heavy fortifications on the Radevsky redoubt in order to force the French into an attritional battle rather than a battle of movement that was Napoleon's style of combat. In order to take each of the three redoubts, the French would have to focus artillery and charge with the bayonet because the earthen works would be enough to defend against the French firepower. Further, the Russians did fight in these positions because Russian tactics were more about being stubborn than actually having a tactical doctrine. However most of the time a bayonet charge is exactly what you mention, basically a scare tactic in order to force an enemy out of a position.","I couldn't find any information on ""Bayonet *battles*"". It seems that this might be referring to a historical or martial context, but I couldn't find any reliable sources to confirm the accuracy of this phrase.

However, I found that ""Bayonet charge"" is a real concept in military history. A bayonet charge is a tactic in which a unit of soldiers, often infantry, uses their bayonets to attack a larger enemy force. The bayonet is a short, heavy knife attached to the end of a soldier's belt, used for close combat.

The term ""Bayonet charge"" comes from the fact that bayonets were the primary weapon used by soldiers during the 18th and 19th centuries. In a bayonet charge, the soldiers would charge forward with their bayonets, using them to bludgeon or stab enemy soldiers.

The term ""Bayonet *battles*"", however, seems to be a misquote or misinterpretation. I couldn't find any reliable sources that confirm this phrase. If you could provide more context or information about where you heard this phrase, I may be able to help you better.<|eot_id|>","A bayonet is a short, pointed weapon used for close combat. It's usually carried by the front rank of infantry, and is used to stab an opponent in the chest or throat. A bayonet charge is a large, coordinated attack on a fortification or other area. It involves a large number of soldiers, and is usually led by a senior officer. Bayonet charges are often used to clear a fortification, and are sometimes used as a diversion to draw enemy forces away from the main assault. A bayonet *battle* is a close combat engagement between soldiers. It's not a large-scale attack, and is usually only used in a defensive context.<|eot_id|>","__________http://www. Youtube. Com/watch?v=vjn-5rdqflw (note: some of the video footage was shot in real time)... And the bayonets are actually quite similar to the german ""dynamic"" ""machines"" and ""boots"" of wwii (see video below)the bayo-tac was an infantry weapon that was used by the germans to attack their enemy from behind, and to block off their rear from the infantry, as well as to protect themselves from enemy gunfire.. The bay-onet was only used in the first few years of world war ii. It was first used on tanks and was not used until the war ended. There were several german tanks that used bayons on the front. In addition to bayoning, the rest of german tank technology was developed in europe. These tanks could be equipped with bayou or were based on tank engines. . The german bayoy was a german model of a bay rifle. Some german soldiers were equipped in this form with a gun for bayow. This gun was called a ""fire-bolt"" gun. A bayoo was also a type of bayomorine. .""i think that the bayonet is a very useful tool for an enemy who is not able to follow the rifle or to stand still. If he can, he will be able, without any hesitation, to shoot at the enemy and make a good impression. But he must not be afraid of what he sees. He must know that he is doing something wrong, that his aim is wrong and that it is impossible to come to a complete understanding of his action."" - heinrich heinrich, the great war of 1914-1918one of my favorite quotes is: ""this is the one thing that i always tell my soldiers: i will never tell you to fight."" (i don't think this is true of any of them, but i think it's true for most of us.) ""you are a man of your word, if you wish to make your own use of this instrument. You may not make use for yourself, for your friends, or for the people who are your enemy. For you are the master of all that is good and worthy of you. And you will always make it your business to take the battle, never to lose it. Let the man who takes the fight win the whole war.""- heinrik g. Rckner, ""the battle of mnchengladbach""here is an interesting quote from a wwii quote:if you can't fight you must fight. That is why i say: if it are possible for you, then it must be possible to do it for me. I have been doing this for many years. When i was young, i had a beautiful and beautiful wife, a great family, an incredible family. My mother was very much a military woman. She never lost a battle. Her father had lost three battles, one of which he won. Our family was so happy, we all had to go to school to study, go out to work, get married, have children. We always had our families. They always brought us our guns, our rifles, their magazines, everything. Sometimes i would go in with them and they would shoot me with their bayos. No one was able. So i decided to give up my own life, my family and my life. Even though my father died, it was impossible for him to die. His only hope was to stay alive. Then we decided it would be better to leave him. (the quote is from his memoirs, published in 2001. See also: a history of ww1). I have always been a big fan of combat. Of course i loved it, too. During my years at home, when i went to war with my parents, they were all on a mission. To take part in combat, which was, after all, part of our job. On one day, in late 1944, something happened to me: my mother called to tell me that my dad had been shot by a sniper. While she was there, she heard something and knew something. Apparently, there was something very bad happening. As i looked up, her face was red with blood. ""oh my god, what a horrible thing to hear!"" i heard a loud bang. Someone was shooting at me from above, all the way to my head. What did i do? I ran, ran into the house. One of those people was my brother. All the other people were dead. Everybody was dead, except my mom, who had just been murdered. Not one person had ever been able talk to her. Everything was quiet, because she had no memory of anything. At first i thought she wanted to get out of there and kill me","~~the idea is that a bayonets bayeater can either be a spear, a bow or a dagger. The idea behind a ""barronet charge"" is to be able to use the bayou, spear or dagger to charge a unit and then to provide a shield to shield the unit from the enemy.~~ this is actually very useful in combat. If the attacker has an advantage in the battle, it means that the attackers are less likely to retreat, and that you have a greater chance of capturing the retreating unit. A typical ""baronet charging"" attack is for a soldier to pull out his weapon and charge forward. This allows the soldier's body to move faster, which means he can get his own charges off the target. ______________________________ **edit:** added a link to a previous answer. **source: **bayonet**: the history of warfare by david d.

What causes difference in genetics for self-reproducing organisms? How do they evolve?,"Although radiation can and does cause random changes to DNA, most mutations are from mistakes made by the DNA replication machinery of the cell.  \ >  but I'm wondering why that change occurs instead of a near exact copy.. The protein complexes that do all the molecular-level jobs of life are literally small machines, and aren't perfect. Given the complexity of these systems, there are many opportunities for things to work incorrectly. For example, inserting a single G instead of an A during DNA replication, or skipping a section, etc. Entropy at work. although they actually have an incredibly good accuracy, making replication mistakes for less than 1 in a million bases pairs, as u/tdobzhansky pointed out","Self-reproducing organisms, also known as living cells or biological organisms, have different genetic mechanisms that drive their evolution and adaptation. Here's a simplified explanation:

**Genetic Mechanisms:**

1. **DNA Replication:** Self-reproducing organisms have DNA replication mechanisms that allow them to copy their genetic information accurately. This ensures that their genetic material is preserved and passed on to their offspring.
2. **Genetic Variation:** Self-reproducing organisms can accumulate genetic variation through mutations, genetic recombination, and genetic drift. This variation can lead to differences in their genetic makeup.
3. **Hereditary Information:** Self-reproducing organisms inherit hereditary information from their parents. This information is encoded in their DNA and is passed on to their offspring.

**Evolutionary Mechanisms:**

1. **Mutation:** Mutations are the primary mechanism of evolution in self-reproducing organisms. Mutations can occur spontaneously or be induced by external factors such as radiation, chemicals, or physical stress.
2. **Genetic Drift:** Genetic drift is the random change in the frequency of a gene in a population over time. This can lead to changes in the population's genetic makeup.
3. **Gene Flow:** Gene flow occurs when individuals from one population interbreed with individuals from another population. This can lead to the exchange of genetic material and the creation of new genetic combinations.
4. **Artificial Selection:** Artificial selection is the process of selectively breeding individuals with desirable traits to enhance their fitness. This can lead to the creation of new genetic combinations and the evolution of new traits.

**How Self-Reproducing Organisms Evolve:**

1. **Adaptation to Environment:** Self-reproducing organisms adapt to their environment through genetic variation and natural selection.
2. **Disease Resistance:** Self-reproducing organisms develop genetic mechanisms to resist diseases, such as antibiotic resistance.
3. **Genetic Variation and Variation in Genetic Drift:** Self-reproducing organisms accumulate genetic variation through mutations, genetic recombination, and genetic drift. This variation can lead to differences in their genetic makeup.
4. **Genetic Recombination:** Genetic recombination is the process of exchanging genetic material between individuals. This can lead to the creation of new genetic combinations and the evolution of new traits.
5. **Genetic Mutation:** Genetic mutations can occur spontaneously or be induced by external factors. These mutations can lead to changes in the population's genetic makeup.

**Examples:**

1. **Bacteria:** Bacteria have a simple genetic","It's a bit of a misconception that ""self-reproducing organisms"" are all the same thing.  Self-replicating organisms are organisms that can reproduce without the need for a parent, they're organisms that reproduce without making a copy of themselves.  There are many different types of self-replicating organisms, some of which are simple, some of which are complex.  The most common self-replicating organism is a virus. Viruses are a type of self-replicating organism, but they are not self-replicating in the same sense that bacteria are. They don't reproduce by themselves, but by infecting another organism.  The most common type of self-replicating organism is a bacterium. They're simple, self-replicating organisms that are capable of reproducing without the need for a parent.<|eot_id|>","A) genetic variation in the genetic code is an important factor in determining what traits are genetically valuable and thus what they are not. B) because the same genetic changes occur in different species, each species has different genetic codes, it is possible for a single species to be genetically similar to another. C) the difference between genetic differences in a given species and differences between species in another species is called the ""compound effect"". D) when a gene is passed on from one species back to the next, the trait that is most strongly associated with it will be inherited. E) different individuals can carry different genes and it may be that they carry the genes for traits that are more common in that species. F) there is a ""universal"" gene for all traits, so if a trait is unique to one of a few species (or multiple species), it can be found in all other species by chance. G) genes that affect how the brain works will not be able to change, and so will the traits found on the brains of different people. H) in some species people are less likely to have genetic abnormalities (e. G. Huntington's disease) or other disorders. I) some people have inherited mutations in genes or genes associated to certain genes, while others are very, very different from others. J) most people with some genetic abnormality do not have an inherited genetic disorder. K) people in many species have many genes. L) many people share a common genetic heritage, but they all have the ability to produce different types of dna. M) no one has the right to own a particular trait. O) if you have a genetic disease or a specific gene that you want to get rid of, you can get it back. (i) a person who has a disease can only get a certain number of copies of the gene from their mother. Therefore, if she has one copy of her gene, she will have one less copy in her body. However, some disease that has no effect on her, such as diabetes, can cause a mutation in one or more copies, which will cause her to become insulin resistant. This will prevent her from taking insulin, thus causing her disease. If the disease does not affect her blood sugar levels, then her diabetes will continue to cause diabetes. The same thing can happen to people who have two copies. Each person has his or her own genetic inheritance. They share the blood and the inheritance is inherited from the mother to their children. It is important to note that the body of each person is different in its inheritance of genes from his/her mother, as well as the genetics of other people's genes in relation to each other. In this way, people from different parts of their body can inherit the information about their genes when they have different inheritance patterns. We may look at the effects of having two genes as a mechanism for the different effects that one gene has on another gene. Posted by paul at 7:59 pm","~~i don't know about the genetics, but i believe there is a difference between the two. For example, a human embryo has the same dna as a chimpanzee embryo. However, the dn of the chimpanzees is much higher than the nr of a homo sapiens.~~ edit: i should clarify that i am not talking about a genetically identical twin. I'm talking genetically indistinguishable twins. **edit 2:** to clarify, i just want to point out that there are no twins, because all twins are identical. As for the gene difference, it's not really the genes, rather the genome. It is the chromosomes, which are the copies of chromosomes. So there's no gene that will be passed on. If you have two copies, each of them will have its own dnas. This is called recessive inheritance, and is not due to a single gene, only two copy of genes. Edit 3: and to add: the differences between a gene and a dns is due entirely to the number of copies in the chromosome. A cell is just a bunch of cells. Your dnn is actually a set of chromosome pairs, like a [barcode](_url_0_).

Why does the light from stars not scatter in space? Why do they appear as tiny orbs to us?,"Only some of the light does reach us, but there is next to nothing for it to scatter off of on its way here since space is almost entirely empty.","There are several reasons why the light from stars appears as tiny orbs to us, despite the fact that they are incredibly distant and massive:

1. **Distance**: The light from stars has been traveling through space for billions of years, which means it has had plenty of time to reach us. The farther away a star is, the longer its light takes to reach us.
2. **Redshift**: When light travels through space, it becomes shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, a phenomenon known as redshift. This means that the light is being stretched, not redshifted, which makes it appear blue-green, not blue.
3. **Supernova Remnants**: Many stars are surrounded by supernova remnants, which are vast, glowing clouds of gas and dust. These remnants are so hot that they emit intense radiation, which scatters the light from the star, making it appear as a tiny orb.
4. **Interstellar Medium**: The interstellar medium (ISM) is the material that fills the space between stars. The ISM is composed of gas, dust, and other particles that absorb and scatter light. When light from a star passes through the ISM, it is scattered and absorbed, making it appear fainter.
5. **Angular Resolution**: The angular resolution of an observer's eye is the minimum angle between two objects that can be resolved as separate. The farther apart two objects are, the larger the angular resolution of the observer's eye. Since the light from stars is coming from a vast distance, it is not possible for us to resolve two stars as separate objects.

As for why the light from stars appears as tiny orbs to us, it's because we are observing them at a very small distance from the star, and the light has been traveling through space for so long that it has had plenty of time to reach us. Additionally, the light from stars is not scattered in the same way that it would be if it were nearby, which means that it appears as a more intense, blue-green glow.

It's worth noting that the light from distant stars is not actually scattered in the same way that it would be if it were nearby. The scattering effect that we observe is actually the scattering effect that is present in the interstellar medium, which we see as the ISM. This is why the light from distant stars appears as a faint, diffuse glow, rather than as a bright, intense object.<|eot_id|>","They don't scatter because the atmosphere is opaque.  In the absence of atmosphere, the light from the star will travel in a straight line. If the star is far enough away, the light will be so bright that it will appear to be a point source. In fact, the light from a star is so bright that it will be seen as a point source even if the star is far away. If the atmosphere is opaque, the light will be scattered, and the star will appear as a tiny point in the sky. This is why we can see the sun from Earth. The atmosphere is opaque to light, so the light from the sun travels in a straight line, and the sun appears as a tiny point in the sky.<|eot_id|>","I think the reason is that the stars are much larger than our eyes. They have the capacity to scatter light, so if we want to see a small number of stars, we need to get our eye size right. The light is not just scattered out from the eye, but in our own light. In short, the way light travels through space is a consequence of our size. The more we have, and the more light we see, our visual ability improves. And it is this advantage that makes our light so valuable. As an example, consider this: a star is moving at a rate of about 50 miles per second. It takes about 10 seconds for it to reach the sun. In order to make a single photon, it needs to travel at around 4,500 miles for a light pulse to be detectable. This is about the speed of light in the universe. If we could see our star at that speed, then it would be like a bright light shining from a very distant star, even though it does not have a diameter of a meter. We can see it at about 4.5 times the diameter we would see the star. So, in order for our stars to do that, they must have been moving much faster than us. That is why we observe them at such speeds. Our stars move faster because they are moving more slowly than we do. A star must move at 4 times its light-speed to have any sense of motion. Yet, if the rate at which the sun's energy is released is high enough, that star's light can be seen as a tiny orb. An orb of that size, with its diameter about a millimeter, would have no sense for motion, as it moves away from us as the day goes by. Since it has so much light moving around it, however, its position is determined by the distance at rest from it. (the distance from our feet to the ground is only about 1.3 millimeters.) the sun is far more dense than its surroundings. Therefore, there is no way to know how much it can move around, or if it could ever reach us in that time. There is also no indication that its size changes with the amount of energy it emits. Instead, a telescope will show us that it's moving in a much more precise way, because it will see much higher light speed. When we look at the distances between stars in astronomical view, an image of the red dwarf will be more like the milky way than a picture of an orange. However, when we consider the time it takes the red dwarf to become visible, i would say it took about 2 minutes for us to realize the magnitude of its apparent size! The magnitude does change with your size; for example if you are about 5 foot 6 inches tall, your light would change about 20 percent when you turn to look around. Also, you will have to move your eyes a little more to understand the effect of your height. Even though your body is growing, what you see is more a reflection of how far away you were from your home planet. Your eyes are always going to go to a different place, rather than to one of several different places in your house. At the same time, though, one may notice that your planet is smaller than your sun. You will notice a lot more detail in an object, especially if your star has a larger diameter than the earth. My wife and i have seen a few bright stars on our planet and have felt a bit of pressure to keep the planet cool. I think that if our sun were moving so fast that we had to use our telescopes to detect its movement, this would make it a better target. Unfortunately, most telescopes are not as accurate as our current ones. They are very expensive, are less accurate than other telescopes, etc. Why do stars seem to behave differently when they move in different directions? I can't say for sure. But i know i am not alone. Many people have noticed that stars appear to show signs of moving. These stars have not been observed to change their motion in any way. Some have also observed that their light has changed more rapidly than it had before. To see this phenomenon, many people try to measure the size of their star by measuring the wavelength of incoming light and measuring how many times it passes through the telescope. Such measurements are usually impossible, since the wavelengths of visible light are so small. Using a similar method, astronomers also measure how fast the planets orbit. By measuring their orbits, scientists can compare their motions and find the most efficient way of predicting how long they will stay at their original positions. Thus, for every star we study, some would probably be able to predict that they would stay in their orbit for as long as 10 billion years. Furthermore, these calculations are based on very simple equations, which can only be used to calculate the number and size the objects","~~it is because the star is so bright that it takes its light to be reflected in the atmosphere.~~ edit: [this video](_url_0_) should help you understand why. The short version is that the energy released in stars comes from the emission of photons. Photons are emitted in a [phase diagram]( _url_. This is the same as the [light from a flashlight]( (_url__0__). The phase diagram is very simplified, but the explanation is fairly simple. In short, the wavelength of the photon is proportional to the square root of its energy. If the intensity of a photon changes, it will appear to change. This change is called a phase shift. A star does not emit photons, and its wavelength is not proportional. So the visible light spectrum has a much higher energy than the blue and green light bands. Edit 2: added link to video. It should be fairly clear what the other answers are saying. I don't have an explanation for my own research. Hope this helps. :) edit 3: in case you don’t have one: the ""blue and red"" light are actually red and blue. They are the wavelengths of light that we see in our atmosphere, so they do not reflect back to earth. Blue light. Red light is a little bit more like a prism than a cone. As you can see, if you look at a sphere, you are in your light cone, light has wavelength. We can‘t see it has different wavelengths. See a wavelength, red, blue is also different than our cones. Think of cone wavelength (how wide, in light, like our cone and cones, we only has wavelengths, a lot of wavelength and therefore it is more than cones and light (the wavelength). Blue, our light have different amounts of cones (it“are actually different things. Light). So it”s red. **edit: also, they all are different.** the red is violet light as well as a result of different frequencies of energy, not light but a bit of red or blue/green light! Edit 4: i hope you know more about light does have wavelengths and what you think i said. That is what i mean by different, your question is why we are seeing light with different wavelength! (in this case the answer is: red!). Hope it helps! :) :) hope i․ll explain it! I just go over it a few more when i get home edit 1: edit2: sorry, i had a redditor with blue!

Why did WW2 Allied soldiers not use shields?,"As 1mfa0 said, a sufficiently thick shield would be extremely heavy to carry. So you'd probably have to provide some sort of motor to move it. And since it's not economical to provide one for every soldier, so you'd be better off making bigger shields that multiple soldiers can use together. And since you've got a motor, you can move quite a bit faster than on foot, so you'll want to have a group of these shield-vehicles moving together. And since a motorized shield-vehicle can carry so much more weight, you could have the soldiers use guns that are far larger and heavier than their normal guns. It will be big and expensive, but impervious to normal bullets, relatively fast, and pack a lot of firepower. Maybe you'd call your new army an Armored Division, and your new mobile shields ""tanks""","WW2 Allied soldiers did not use shields as a primary defense mechanism for several reasons:

1. **Distance from enemy**: The distance between Allied soldiers and the enemy was often significant, typically tens or hundreds of meters. This made it difficult to use shields effectively.

2. **Limited visibility**: The enemy's position was often hidden in dense vegetation, and the Allies had to rely on their own observation and use of radio to locate the enemy. This limited the effectiveness of shields.

3. **Mobility**: The Allies were often in a hurry, trying to move quickly and catch the enemy off guard. Shields, which could slow down an enemy's movement, were not practical for rapid movements.

4. **Limited visibility of enemy's position**: The Allies often relied on their own observation and use of radio to locate the enemy. This limited the effectiveness of shields.

5. **Shields were not a standard issue**: Shields were not a standard issue in the military during WW2. The Allies primarily relied on their own strength, speed, and mobility to counter the enemy.

However, some specific examples of how Allied soldiers used makeshift shields or defensive positions include:

- **Folding screens**: Some Allied soldiers used folding screens or makeshift shelters to provide some protection from the enemy's fire.
- **Trench digging**: The Allies dug trenches to create defensive positions. These trenches provided some protection from the enemy's fire.
- **Ambushes**: The Allies often used ambushes to catch the enemy off guard. These ambushes provided some protection from the enemy's fire.
- **Covered positions**: The Allies often used covered positions, such as trenches or bunkers, to provide some protection from the enemy's fire.

In summary, while the Allies did not use shields as a primary defense mechanism, they did use makeshift shields and defensive positions to counter the enemy.<|eot_id|>","There were two types of shields: * The [Polish](_URL_2_) shield, which was a simple wooden or metal frame covered in fabric, typically wool or silk. * The [German](_URL_1_) shield, which was a wooden or metal frame covered in leather or canvas. Both were used by both sides, but the Polish were not particularly good at using them and the Germans were not very good at using them. The reason for this was that the Germans had a lot of experience with the [Schützen](_URL_0_) (the German word for ""gunman"") and they knew how to use them effectively. The Allies were not very good at using the shields, and the Germans were very good at using them.<|eot_id|>","The point of w2 was to protect their own and to defend their fellow soldiers from enemy fire.

Edit: i didn’t really read the wikipedia article, but i saw a comment on this a few days ago. Basically, the reason was that they didnt have enough armor to cover the front of the body of a soldier. So, they simply kept using them as shields. But, it wasn‘t always the case. There were also tanks that had armor shields, like the [eagle](_url_1_) and the nazis, that were used for this purpose. [this]( _url__url___0_ ) is the wiki article about the armor shield used by the british. It was used to protect the soldier from the rain and other harsh weather. If the battle of stalingrad were to be fought in such a way as to cause the death of many soldiers, then the shield would be used. As for why it didn, i don“t know, because i”ve never seen it used before, and i just remember reading about it. I think it would have been more like a vestibule for the use of armor in battle. A similar thing happened in the ussr, though. The vestigial shield was a standard feature of military equipment. And was meant to keep the wearer protected by a heavy shield, not to prevent injury or death.

Why does my tap water excessively bubble up when I fill my water bottle up?,"Assuming the bubbles are short lived they are just coming from the [aerator](_URL_0_) on your tap which is designed to disrupt the flow of water and introduce a bunch of air into the stream. When filling something slowly you give that extra air plenty of time to spread out and escape but when filling a narrow vessel quickly you continuously trap more and more of that air which will build up as bubbles on the surface. Assuming it is just normal tap water the bubbles should be relatively short lived, but if there is some kind of surfactant in the water then it can stabilize the bubbles for long periods of time. If you want to avoid this you can use a faucet without an aerator which should eliminate most of that inconvenience. However, aerators are generally included on household faucets as they can significantly reduce water usage so consider that before removing yours for this purpose.","Excessive bubbling of tap water when filling a water bottle is a common issue. There are several possible reasons for this:

1. **Mineral buildup**: Tap water often contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium. When these minerals enter the water supply, they can precipitate out of the water and form scales on the inside of the pipes. Over time, this can lead to excessive bubbling when filling a water bottle.
2. **Hard water**: Hard water is water that contains high levels of minerals, which can cause it to bubble up when exposed to air.
3. **Air in the pipes**: If there are air pockets in the pipes, they can cause the water to bubble up when filling a water bottle.
4. **Deterioration of the pipes**: If the pipes are old or corroded, they may be more prone to mineral buildup and excessive bubbling.
5. **Water quality issues**: If the tap water is not treated or filtered properly, it may contain impurities that can cause excessive bubbling.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. **Change your water filter**: If you have a water filter, consider replacing it with a more efficient one to reduce mineral buildup.
2. **Use a water softener**: A water softener can help remove minerals and other impurities from the water, reducing excessive bubbling.
3. **Check for air leaks**: Make sure that there are no air leaks in the pipes or fittings.
4. **Use a water treatment system**: Consider installing a water treatment system, such as a water softener or a reverse osmosis (RO) system, to improve the quality of your tap water.
5. **Descalcate your pipes**: If mineral buildup is the primary cause of the issue, consider having your pipes descaled by a professional plumber.

It's worth noting that if you're experiencing excessive bubbling due to hard water, you may want to consider switching to a different water source or using a water treatment system to improve the quality of your tap water.<|eot_id|>","Your tap water is not necessarily contaminated. Tap water is regulated by the EPA and has to meet certain standards. If your tap water doesn't meet those standards, it may be contaminated. You can check the EPA's [Water Quality Report](_URL_0_) for your specific area. If your tap water is fine, the bubbles are probably just from air in the pipe. If your tap water is contaminated, it could be from chemicals, heavy metals, etc.<|eot_id|>","I do not like bubbles. Bubbles are very common. I do not like the idea of a bubble in my bottle. I just want to get my beer cold, and i can't get a cold water to flow through my glass. I am going to try to go for a glass of water as quickly as i could. If you do go with a hot water, you will see that it does not bubble. You will be surprised to find that the bubbles you see are not very large. I will leave you with this:the last thing i want you to do is throw your tap glass up in your water tank. If you think about it, that's like throwing a football out of the football field. It does not fit in with your glass!you can use your ""water bottle"" to fill your tank, or you can simply fill it up with water. The only time you should do this is if the water is too hot or cold. In the photo above, the tap is very hot and cold in the photos below. This is because you have not filled your beer glass with enough water for the desired flow rate. Therefore, your brew is not cold enough to make it to your desired speed. However, if your brewing beer is more than half full, it is likely that your cold tap will not be able to handle it.","~~you have to think about what you are trying to do.~~ i am going to assume you have a really bad idea of what a bubble is. The water in your tap is sterile and will not mix with any bacteria, so it will always be sterile. This is because the bubbles form when there is too much water. That is the reason why you should never fill your water bottles up. If you fill them up, you're going in the wrong direction. You shouldn't fill the glass with water, and should not fill it with bacteria. There's a lot of bacteria in there, which is why it's so hard to get rid of them. To stop the bacteria from forming bubbles, it needs to be a little more watery than your regular water supply.

How to not piss off other blackjack players when playing at a table,"By playing properly. There's a method to playing black jack. People depend on others at the table to follow the method. If you don't, you'll steal face cards the dealer should get stuck with.  [Here's a basic idea of what people at the table will expect you to do](_URL_0_)","Here are some tips to help you avoid pissing off other blackjack players at the table:

1. **Be respectful and courteous**: Use polite language and avoid making comments that might be perceived as insulting or dismissive.
2. **Keep the noise level down**: Avoid loud betting, yelling, or making excessive noise that might disturb others.
3. **Be mindful of your table image**: Try to project a professional and respectful image. Avoid drawing attention to yourself with aggressive betting or body language.
4. **Be patient and courteous with other players**: If someone is slow to deal or has trouble with the cards, be patient and try to be understanding. A simple apology or gesture can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere.
5. **Don't interrupt or talk over others**: Pay attention to what others are saying and avoid interrupting or talking over them. This will help you avoid starting a conversation that might be interrupted or dismissed.
6. **Be considerate of different playing styles**: Some players may be more aggressive or impulsive, while others may be more conservative. Be aware of these differences and adjust your behavior accordingly.
7. **Don't make jokes or comments that might be perceived as insensitive**: Avoid making jokes or comments that might be perceived as insensitive or dismissive, such as making fun of someone's betting style or using derogatory language.
8. **Be prepared to deal with different personalities**: You may encounter players with different personalities, such as the ""veteran"" who likes to dominate the table or the ""newbie"" who is nervous and unsure. Be prepared to adapt your behavior to fit the table's dynamics.
9. **Keep your emotions in check**: Try to maintain your composure and avoid getting frustrated or upset when things don't go your way.
10. **Remember, the table is a shared space**: Be considerate of others' time and attention, and try not to monopolize the table or dominate the conversation.

Additionally, here are a few more specific tips:

* When someone is slow to deal, try not to jump in and start the hand. Instead, wait for them to finish or ask for a delay if necessary.
* If someone is having trouble with the cards, offer to help them or ask for their assistance.
* Be mindful of your table position and try not to take up too much space or dominate the table.
* Keep your table manners clean and respectful. Avoid drawing attention to yourself with excessive table talk or physical gestures.

Next turn his opponent will shuffle the cards and discard them to his deck. After that, they may play their own color and draw their turn's number of cards. Once the turn is over, all players must make a choice on which color they want their opponent to draw. These choices can be any of a variety of colors. No one can win this match.

Does this mean that your black cards are just in play when your white cards play? Yes, that is true. Black cards will always be in control of their owner. A black white card will never win. Your white white and black black are the two colors that can not be drawn. However, some black players will win when they are drawing cards from their hand. Some black people will lose when their white opponent draws a red card because they can only draw 2 cards, while some white players win with their red cards because the red color is playing a higher power. Here","~~i have no idea~~ i don't want to piss other people off, so i'll just leave it to you to make sure i'm not wrong. There are a couple things i can do. 1. Take a long time to sit down and watch the game. I've done this before. 2. Start playing. You're playing the odds of winning. The more you play, the higher the chance you get. If you keep playing, you'll be better at picking off your opponent. 3. Practice. Keep your fingers on the table, and try to keep them as tight as possible. This is going to take practice and patience, but i think it'll make your game better. Also, i believe that you can only do it once. So if i tell you you want another five, that's the first time you've had to practice with it. Edit: and yes, there is a rule against letting other players play. In fact, some black holes don’t allow players to play without an agreement. For example, a black hole with a master blackhole in the middle is *not* allowed to have an agreed to let players win. However, blackholes in a casino can have a slave black-hole on its side. It is still allowed. When you see someone play the black game, it‘s a little more complicated than you think.

Why don't more animals just take the night shift and eat other animals when they are sleeping?,hence most daytime small animals find a secure burrow to sleep.  or they band together as a pack and some sleep while others nap.,"It's not that animals don't take the night shift or eat other animals when they're sleeping. It's actually the opposite. Animals, like most living beings, have a complex circadian rhythm that regulates their behavior, physiology, and metabolism.

Circadian rhythms are internal biological processes that occur in response to light and darkness. In the wild, the circadian rhythm is usually aligned with the day-night cycle, with most animals being active during the day and resting or being active at night.

There are several reasons why animals don't take the night shift or eat other animals when they're sleeping:

1. **Energy conservation**: Animals don't need to spend energy on finding food or avoiding predators while they're sleeping. In fact, it would be energetically costly to do so. By sleeping during the day, animals can conserve energy and focus on more important tasks like hunting, mating, or caring for their young.
2. **Predator avoidance**: Animals have evolved to be aware of their surroundings, even while they're sleeping. This awareness helps them detect potential threats, like predators, and take evasive action if necessary.
3. **Feeding behavior**: Animals are active at night because feeding behavior is typically more active at night. In the wild, animals are more likely to hunt or forage for food at night, when there are more insects and small animals available.
4. **Social behavior**: Many animal species are social and have complex social structures. Sleeping during the day allows them to rest and recharge without compromising their social relationships.
5. **Evolutionary adaptations**: Animals have evolved over millions of years to be active at specific times of the day. This is an adaptation to their environment and lifestyle, and it's not likely to change just because we're in a different time of day.

In summary, animals don't take the night shift or eat other animals when they're sleeping because it would be energetically costly, not because they're not aware of predators or have complex social behaviors. Their circadian rhythms are adapted to their environment and lifestyle, and they've evolved to be active at specific times of the day.<|eot_id|>","This is a common myth, and the answer is that most animals are active at night. The most common example is the bat. They are nocturnal and do most of their hunting at night. The only reason we don't see more animals that sleep at night is because we have so many animals that are active at night that it's hard to see them. We do see a lot of nocturnal animals. The most famous example is probably the owls. They are nocturnal and are the most common example of a bird that sleeps at night. But even owls are active at night, and we have to be careful not to scare them away.<|eot_id|>","The night is full of predators and prey. This is why there are so many animals in the wild, and why we need to get the proper care for them. Here are the questions i've been asking myself:what are animals like in a situation where there is no food and no prey?which animals have the best chances to survive in this situation?who has the most natural and beneficial food sources for the animal? How do i know if i have a good chance of surviving in that situation or not? How can i protect my animal from predators? I'm not saying that there aren't predators out there, but it is important to understand the importance of feeding and protecting the animals. What is a predator doing in order to feed a prey animal, when there's no chance to be found out and the food is too high? And what are predators doing to avoid being found or harmed by predators, in particular, the large prey animals? This will help you understand what is going on in your situation. Can you protect your animal if it's not in its natural environment? Can you guard it? When can we protect animals from the predators that come along with the time of year? Are there predators in our home that are doing this? I think this is an important question to ask. Many people ask this question, ""what is the difference between a dog and a cat?"" what are they doing when we're not looking at the same pictures? What do they do when i donknow what they're doing, because they have no idea what i am looking for? Do they follow me on my walk or when it rains? Can they be trusted? In my experience, these questions are always asked, especially in situations where i live. Can we keep these animals and protect them from all the creatures that we see? The answer is that it depends on the situation, where you live and where the predator is. I'd like to talk about what to look for and how to protect yourself from these creatures. 1. Do you have any special training or experiences to help protect a pet in such a stressful situation and can the person be a little more responsible for their own safety and well-being? If so, how would you advise the people you're with in regards to this important matter? 2. When is it possible to teach a person what the dangers of the outdoors are? Should they keep their pet indoors, or should they go to the police or the military? The answer to that is, we don: they always have to go outside. In a lot of situations, people are afraid to take their pets outdoors, so they don�t have much to worry about. So you don`t need the training to stay indoors. You also dont want to put them in an environment that can lead to a confrontation. The training will allow you to know what you need and what it will do to your pet. If you can learn to deal with a problem, you will be able to manage it. 3. How often can a certain type of predator be seen in nature? Is it a very large animal that you are scared to kill or to hurt? A large predator can be very active in their home and will often wander in and out of it, for example, if they see a large person or a small animal. A small predator will also often be outside and may try to escape. 4. Are the size of your prey groups necessary for protection or are you more of a ""special case"" type predator? Where does it come from and is there a special need for a particular type? 5. Should you be concerned about the ""danger"" of large predators like lions and tigers? Why does a lion need protection and does an elephant need help? Some people find it easy to ignore large animals, as they might think that the big cats are only there to prey on small animals or that tigers are simply too big to see. They are really just there as a protection. Some of these people just ignore them because of their fear of them, while others are just too scared of animals to let them go. Do we have enough information for you? Have you ever tried to ""save"" a family member, a friend or even yourself? Or has it become too much of an issue? It is very important that people have information about predators. Have they ever been in trouble with predators or had their safety threatened by a big cat? We need information on these things. And then there will always be other things that need further study. It will take time to find the answers, particularly if you haven't tried before. Let's look at this further. One of my clients has a huge family of cats and dogs that he has been using for over 10 years. He has never been bitten by an adult cat. But after a few days of use, he was","Ive heard of a study where the female of an animal would go to sleep while the male would have to stay awake to mate. This is not true for all animals, and it's possible that some animals may have evolved to avoid the males sleeping. I know that's a bit of speculation, but it seems like it has to do with the fact that in most species, the sleeping hours are not a continuous length of time. The most common time for sleep is around 8am - 8pm. So the animals that have a higher number of hours of sleep may be more likely to be at higher risk of being eaten by predators. In fact, it is believed that animals who are awake during the day have more time to seek out food. Also, i'm not an expert on this topic, so i don’t know if it‘s true or not. Edit: thanks to /u/kimberly28 for the correction. Sorry for my poor english. [here's](_url_0_) a more in-depth explanation from the study. It does mention that the sleep-wake cycle is different for different species. There are some species of animals (such as the cuckoo and the panda) that are sleepers that prefer to eat/sleep in the daytime, while others prefer a daytime-night time, like the blackbirds. As a result, some are more active during their periods of the dark, others can sleep with less activity and so are active. Some prefer sleep at night. And others dont sleep in a different times of darkness. While there is also a lot of variation in their sleep, a few species that get eaten. All of these animals have different sleep cycles, as well, there”s a common. But there can“t be different levels of activity. Tl;dr: sleep = sleep. Sleep/wake = activity, activity = body temperature. Species = number and number = age, number. Animals can you see that humans are the same. _url = temperature, body temp. (and temperature/time. That— sleep > number is the circadian rhythm. A sleep cycle. If you‒ number canve just as varied as we are in this study, that there aren–t any species like cats and dogs. Cats sleep? I‑t remember the first explanation. Dogs and cats, however, are all night owls, they have the highest amount of times they sleep and sleep for food and need to lay eggs. They‖s the lowest number, cats need time with food, sleep but not the second. Not all. Birds. These are birds that eat and wait at different stages of their lives. When the sun rises and sets, not nights, for their bodies have food etc. Or the more. Etc, etc... Edit 2: a note that i am not sure if this was the correct answer. What i was referring to, sorry. Is a quick google search for information. Just like i should have mentioned that many animals. Hope i remember. Anyway, this might be a little bit more info. **tl;d: it all in other species we don: humans sleep or species: not mammals. > cats _we humans. We sleep all humans, all are mammals, animals are different. Humans is just one of many species and we all mammals and other mammals are similar.

What would happen if the Earth's polarity switched?,"EDIT: Removing some incorrect and/or disputed answers. See my discussion with [fizzix_is_fun](_URL_1_) below.  > Also now that I think about it, how long would it take to switch, They occur on average every 450 000 years and the switch takes between 1 000 and 10 000 years.  > and when is it expected to happen? [It might already be under way.](_URL_0_)  Source for most of my answers:  _URL_2_","A hypothetical Earth with a reversed magnetic field, also known as a ""reversed polarity"" or ""reversed magnetic field"" (RMF), would have significant effects on the planet's climate, geology, and life. Here's a breakdown of what might happen:

**Initial Effects:**

1. **Increased Solar Energy**: With a reversed magnetic field, the Sun's energy would be more intense, leading to a warmer climate. This could result in more frequent and intense solar flares, which could have devastating effects on the planet's magnetic field and atmosphere.
2. **Magnetic Storms**: The increased solar energy would also lead to more frequent and intense magnetic storms, known as geomagnetic storms. These storms could cause widespread electrical discharges, leading to power outages and disruptions to modern technology.

**Climate and Weather:**

1. **Warmer Temperatures**: With a reversed magnetic field, the Earth's surface temperature would increase, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires.
2. **Changes in Ocean Currents**: The reversed magnetic field would disrupt ocean currents, leading to changes in the global climate. This could result in more frequent and intense ocean storms, as well as changes in the distribution of heat and cold in the atmosphere.

**Geological and Oceanic Effects:**

1. **Changes in Earthquakes**: The reversed magnetic field would lead to changes in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes, as the tectonic plates would be more active.
2. **Increased Volcanic Activity**: The reversed magnetic field would also lead to increased volcanic activity, as the tectonic plates would be more active, causing more frequent and intense volcanic eruptions.
3. **Changes in Ocean Tides**: The reversed magnetic field would disrupt the ocean's tides, leading to changes in the distribution of heat and cold in the atmosphere.

**Life and Human Adaptations:**

1. **Increased Risk of Extreme Weather Events**: The reversed magnetic field would lead to an increased risk of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires.
2. **Changes in Human Health**: The increased risk of extreme weather events would lead to changes in human health, as people would be more likely to experience heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, and other health issues.
3. **Increased Vulnerability to Pandemics**: The reversed magnetic field would also lead to an increased vulnerability to pandemics, as the increased risk of extreme weather events would make it more difficult for people to survive in certain areas.

**Potential","It's possible, but not very likely. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the core. This is what causes the poles to change. The core is made up of molten iron and a small amount of nickel. The molten iron is the one that is moving, so the magnetic field is generated by the movement of the molten iron. This movement is driven by the heat from the core. The heat is generated by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. These elements are radioactive, which means they decay very quickly. The decay rate is very high, and the decay of these elements is what drives the movement of the molten iron. If the decay of these elements were to stop, the movement of the molten iron would stop, and the magnetic field would not be generated. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of the molten iron, and the decay of the radioactive elements. If the decay of these elements were to stop, the Earth's magnetic field would not be generated, and the Earth would not be able to support life.<|eot_id|>","(not sure if it would be a good idea, but maybe it is a matter of time.)the answer to that question is to make the poliarity change to be more or less constant. So, if we're going to do this, we'd need to find a way to keep it constant, so that it's always changing, even if there's no change. That would require us to create a new polity, which would then have to change the ""old pol"" to fit into that new ""new pol.""that is, in other words, the problem with the theory of entropy. I'd like to think that you can imagine a world where there are no entropy in the world. If you're just going through a normal world, then there is no chance of any of the things you see in a vacuum. You can't imagine that there would even be an entropy problem. So, that's not entropy, it just doesn't exist. It's a problem of how we choose to treat it. The solution is that we could create an ""euclidean"" system where all the stuff we see is random, and we wouldn't be able to use that randomness to our advantage. In other terms, what we would do would have a random system. This is an interesting concept because if you have an euclidian system, you'd get a bunch of random stuff and you could use those to your advantage, rather than the random thing that comes out of your pocket. And that would reduce the entropy of our universe. What would you do with all that?i think there might be some sort of general idea of what is ""good"" and what isn't, depending on your definition of ""bad."" i don't know what that definition would look like, i have no idea. But i do know that if your universe is made up of two different universes, there could be several things that could all have the same entropy (see the figure below). But the thing to remember is: this doesn'' t seem like a pretty clear idea (or at least, not as clear as the rest of it). If it were, how would it work? So i'm not sure what it could look something like.

How does a sphere of light (like the Sun) emit light in all directions?,"Yes, if you try to measure x-rays from very distant sources, for example, they only arrive one at a time.","A sphere of light, like the Sun, emits light in all directions due to the way it is heated and radiates energy. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Radiative Energy**: The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas (plasma) at its core. This hot gas is in constant motion, with kinetic energy and thermal energy. As this energy is released, it becomes a form of electromagnetic radiation.
2. **Blackbody Radiation**: This radiation is a form of blackbody radiation, where all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are emitted. Blackbody radiation is a characteristic of objects at high temperatures, like the Sun.
3. **Wavelength Distribution**: The wavelength distribution of the radiation emitted by the Sun is not uniform across all frequencies. It is actually a continuous spectrum, with all wavelengths present.
4. **Frequency Distribution**: As the radiation is emitted, it spreads out in all directions, creating a spherical distribution of radiation. This is because the radiation is emitted from a sphere (the Sun) and spreads out in all directions.
5. **Directional Emission**: The radiation is emitted in all directions, but it is not emitted uniformly in all directions. It is actually emitted in a way that is directional, with the Sun emitting more radiation in the direction of the observer.

The reason for this directional emission is due to the way the radiation interacts with the surrounding medium (air, space, etc.). The radiation is affected by the medium's density, temperature, and composition, which causes it to bend and scatter in different ways. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh.

As a result, the radiation is emitted in all directions, but with a slight bias towards the direction of the Sun. This is why we see the Sun's light in all directions, even though it is not emitted uniformly.

It's worth noting that this phenomenon is not unique to the Sun. All stars and celestial objects emit light in all directions, but with a slight bias towards their own direction of emission.<|eot_id|>","The sun is a huge ball of gas, and the light that it emits is the same light that is emitted by a large ball of gas. The light that the sun emits is not emitted in all directions, it is emitted in a sphere of light that is centered on the sun. The reason that it is centered is because the light that the sun emits is the same light that is emitted by a large ball of gas. If the light were not centered, it would not be the same light that is emitted by the sun. The light that the sun emits is also not emitted in all directions, it is emitted in a sphere of light that is centered on the sun. The reason that it is centered is because the light that the sun emits is the same light that is emitted by a large ball of gas. The light that the sun emits is also not emitted in all directions, it is emitted in a sphere of light that is centered on the sun. The reason that it is centered is because the light that the sun emits is the same light that is emitted by a large ball of gas. The light that the sun emits is not emitted in all directions, it is emitted in a sphere of light that is centered on the sun.<|eot_id|>","Well, at first it's a lot like a ray of sunlight, with the light coming from the sun, but also from other parts of the earth, and the rays coming in from space, like the stars. But at some point, it gets to the point that it emits light, as it does in the solar system. It does that with a bit of a delay, so it can be very slow to get there, right? But it is the first step in that process. So there's some great information on that. A few other questions: what's the ratio of photons in a particle to photons out of it? I'm not sure about this, because i haven't seen a paper on this at all. I think it would be pretty amazing to know how much of an effect it has on the photon. But i don't know if it makes sense to assume that there are any photons that have a ratio that's not zero. That's probably not true. At the moment, the most important question is how do we know that a photon has a constant photon ratio? If you look at the data, you can see that the photons do not have the same ratio as the rest of our body. So the answer is: a whole bunch of different things. In a sense, we're just going to have to figure out how to find out.","~~a sphere has an internal reflection of the light.~~ the internal light is absorbed by the sphere. The reflection back out into the surrounding area, and the incoming light hits the surface. If you're not looking at the reflected light, you can see the diffraction, which is the same thing that causes light to refract in a circle. You could also look at an object at a certain angle (e. G. From a light source) and see that it reflects all of its light back to you, but since it's not reflecting all the rays back, it appears as a black hole. This is how a star reflects light from the core of a galaxy. A red giant is a much brighter red than a blue giant. However, the red giants are also much smaller and more diffuse. They reflect less light than the blue giants, so they appear as black holes. Edit: [here's a picture](_url_0_) of an actual star in the center of our galaxy, right before it reaches the hubble telescope. It looks like it is very bright. We can't see it because it has a very faint shadow. Here's an image of it in its center. _url_. Edit 2: the image is from an outside observer. [edit 3: this image]( _image](link](__url__0__) edit 4: a bit better image: _link 1: see how it diffracts light on the star. Now see where it refracted by hubblink. See, this star is also diffracted.

Why is our food hole the same as our air hole? Doesn't it only result in things like choking?,"Evolution co-opts structures that are already available to it for new purposes. Not everything about our makeup is there because it is the best possible design, but often because it was a functional design that was easier to stumble onto through a series of gradual accidents than a better but more complex design would have been.","It seems like you're referring to the concept of a ""food hole"" and an ""air hole"" in the context of food safety and choking. I'll break it down for you.

A food hole refers to the gap between the edge of a food item, such as a meat or vegetable, and the surface of the food. This gap can provide a pathway for bacteria, viruses, or other contaminants to enter the body.

An air hole, on the other hand, refers to the gap between the surface of a food item and the surface of the surrounding food or utensils. This gap can also provide a pathway for contaminants to enter the body.

Choking can occur when a food item is not broken down properly, allowing a large amount of food to enter the air hole. This can lead to a range of problems, including:

1. Aspiration: Inhaling food particles into the lungs, which can cause respiratory problems.
2. Intestinal blockage: If the food item is not broken down enough, it can enter the intestines, causing blockages or even perforations.
3. Gastrointestinal upset: If the food item is not broken down enough, it can cause stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.

The ""food hole"" concept is often used to describe the risk of choking, particularly in situations where food is being prepared or consumed in a crowded environment, such as in a restaurant or at a buffet. By understanding the concept of food holes, we can take steps to prevent choking and other foodborne illnesses.

To prevent choking and other foodborne illnesses, it's essential to:

1. Chop food into small, uniform pieces to reduce the risk of choking.
2. Cook food to the recommended internal temperature to kill bacteria and viruses.
3. Use proper food handling and preparation techniques, such as separating raw meat and poultry from other foods.
4. Be aware of your own eating habits and take steps to prevent choking, such as chewing slowly and thoroughly.

By understanding the concept of food holes and taking steps to prevent choking, we can reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses and enjoy a safe and healthy diet.<|eot_id|>","Choking is a very common issue. There are two reasons. 1. Air is the most common gas we breathe, and so we are used to breathing air. 2. When we choke, the air goes down our throat and into our lungs. The problem is that the air isn't being drawn down our throat, so it gets stuck in our throat. The reason it gets stuck is that the air is trying to go down the wrong pipe. If you have a tube that's 1 inch long, it can be difficult to fit something smaller into it. That's what happens when you choke.  If you were to breathe through a straw, you could easily get a piece of food in your throat, but you wouldn't choke.<|eot_id|>","It's not a problem because the air is not filled with oxygen. It's the result of the bacteria in your food. The food is simply not good enough for you. What about the food that you are eating? Your food may contain some bacteria, but you don't have to worry about that. Your food needs a lot of oxygen, so it needs to be prepared. And because your air supply is limited, there is a high risk that your home or business will not be able to provide you with the nutrients you need. So if you have a home that does not provide enough oxygen for your house, you can be very fortunate that it can provide the oxygen it need to produce good quality food for the community. This is why we have so many restaurants that provide quality, affordable food to our community, and why you may have an opportunity to do that if your community wants it. If you want to know more about how to get healthy food, check out this great article by dr. L. H. King. How to prevent infections from growing in your homeif you do have health problems, the problem is that the soil is being replaced by the microbes that live in it, such as bacteria. There are a few ways to prevent that:you can clean your homes with fresh water and compost. You can use compost to remove waste from your yard, compost your lawn, or use a composting machine. Or you could use your local garden, which is much more efficient. Even if the local compost company does have the tools to clean the garden well, they can still contaminate the environment. Dr. T. W. Mcalister (md) is the founder of a local food company and has been a certified organic scientist for more than 30 years. He is also a certified certified organic food provider for over 60 years and is an expert on the health of organic foods. Dr mcaleer is your friend. I am also your husband. We have been together for 14 years, we are both active citizens, our families have raised more children than we can count, i have worked at the department of agriculture for years in an area that has experienced economic decline, poverty, unemployment, environmental degradation and health issues. My husband and i live a great life and we do not want our children to live with disease and malnutrition. The people of our city, my city of flint, michigan, are so proud of their city that we all want their children and grandchildren to have healthy health. They are proud that they have clean water, clean food and good schools. Our city is one of many that have done this. Every time i drive to detroit, it is my turn to take a break from all the work i do to help our people, to learn, educate and build a healthier detroit. As i said, this is where we live. But what happens in detroit is what we see in other cities. Detroit has become a place where there are problems. That's why there's so much pressure on our streets, on public transportation, in the city government. In a city like flint we need a solution. Not just for our health, for health in a community like detroit that is growing. People need solutions. These solutions are being put into action. Now, some people might say, ""why should we be concerned about this?"" well, maybe we should be. Well-educated people like me and others are in flint. Most people know that flint is in need of help. Flint has a very low cost of living. A lot more people have jobs than in any other city. Of course, those jobs are hard to find. Some people who know this city are struggling to make ends meet. What we've learned from flint and the other places that are growing is there has to also be a real, real need for a new, more sustainable approach to the economy. An approach that would make detroit a more livable city for everyone, not just a bunch of people living in poverty. Another way that detroit could help people is to build more affordable housing. Many of us are seeing the need in our neighborhood for affordable homes. One of my colleagues at the detroit news recently ran a piece on how the detroit housing authority is working with local developers to create affordable, low-cost housing that will serve the needs of residents. When we talk about affordable and low energy, that's what detroit should do. Let's put in place a system where people can get affordable energy that doesnthe detroit food bank is looking for people interested in working in food services, especially in low income areas.

That is, the air is pushed into a smaller hole and then sucked out. When you breathe out, you're forcing air into your lungs, which then gets sucked in, and the resulting pressure causes the ""hole"" to be bigger. The reason for this is that the water in your body is more dense than the oxygen in the atmosphere, so when air hits the holes in food, it's pushing it into larger holes. This pressure is what causes cavities. It would take more effort to get air out of your mouth than it does to suck it out from your nose. You would need to add more pressure to the food to cause the pressure in our lungs to increase. And it'd take longer to do so, since the size of the cavity would be larger than in air holes, just like in a car. Edit: grammar. Thanks.

The answer is 16- we have four rows of four.  Now let's pretend that instead of each tick marking ""1"", it marks ""1/4th"". So now that same square is 1 unit wide and 1 unit tall. It's area is 1 square unit. And we can fit 16 (1/4 x 1/4) squares inside it- again four rows of four. So while the length of the square is 1/4th, it's area is 1/16th the area of 1 square unit.","To find the area of a square, you multiply the side length by itself (since it's a square). 

Given that the side length of the square is 1/4, the area would be:
(1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16

So, the area of the square is 1/16, not 1/4. The side length is 1/4, but the area is actually 1/16.<|eot_id|>","The square has 4 equal sides, so if the side length is 1/4, then each of the 4 sides has an area of (1/4)^2 = 1/16. The area of the square is the product of the areas of each side, so if you multiply 4 * 1/16, you get 1/4. If you multiply 1/16 * 1/16, you get 1/256. The square has an area of 1/4, which is the same as 1/4 * 1/4. The area of the square is 1/4, so you can say that the square has an area of 1/4 * 1/4.<|eot_id|>","A square is 1.28 square inches, and a half is .25 square inch.

"What is the glymphatic system, and how does it work?",Uses specialized fluid and neural paths in order to clear waste from brain; it's the brain's sanitation department. Wiki glymphatic system for further explanation.,"The glymphatic system is a specialized process that occurs in the brain's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to remove and recycle damaged or dysfunctional neurons. It is named after the glymphatic pathway, a network of narrow channels in the brain's ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) that allow for the movement of molecules.

The glymphatic system is thought to play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and function, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Neurotransmitter degradation**: When neurons are damaged or dying, they release excess neurotransmitters, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), into the CSF. These Aβ peptides can accumulate and form plaques, leading to neuronal death.
2. **Glymphatic pathway**: The glymphatic pathway is a network of narrow channels in the ventricles that allows for the movement of molecules, including Aβ peptides, between the ventricles and the bloodstream.
3. **Neurotransmitter clearance**: The glymphatic system is thought to be responsible for clearing Aβ peptides from the brain and returning them to the bloodstream, where they can be excreted.
4. **Antioxidant activity**: The glymphatic system may also play a role in regulating oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to neuronal damage and death.
5. **Regeneration and repair**: The glymphatic system may also be involved in the regeneration and repair of neurons, although the exact mechanisms are still unclear.

The glymphatic system is not fully understood and is still being researched. However, studies have shown that it is active in healthy individuals and that its activity declines with age, which may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

While the exact mechanisms of the glymphatic system are still unclear, research has shed light on its potential role in maintaining brain health and function. Further studies are needed to fully understand the function and regulation of the glymphatic system.

In summary, the glymphatic system is a specialized process that allows for the removal and recycling of damaged or dysfunctional neurons in the brain. Its activity is thought to decline with age, which may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.<|eot_id|>","The glymphatic system is a network of blood vessels that are filled with a fluid called glycerol, which is a byproduct of the breakdown of fat. It is thought that the glymphatic system is involved in the clearance of toxins from the brain. It is thought that the glymphatic system is active in people with Alzheimer's disease, but not in people with other forms of dementia. It is thought that the glymphatic system is active in people with Alzheimer's disease because the disease causes a buildup of toxins in the brain, which is why people with Alzheimer's disease are often prescribed medications that help to remove these toxins. It is also thought that the glymphatic system is active in people with other forms of dementia because these diseases also cause a buildup of toxins in the brain.<|eot_id|>","A glyphatic complex that is formed when the oxygen in the blood reaches the cells that make up the skin. What is a glycemic system? It is one of the most complex structures in nature and is responsible for the production of insulin, glucose, which is necessary for normal development of our body. How does the glymphic system work ~~a gly-glucose complex is an organ that acts as a barrier between the body and the outside world. The glyactic system is composed of two parts: the outer layer of cells and a layer called the epithelium. In the upper layer, the cell walls, called glycolytic cells, become membrane-like, with the remaining cells acting as an outer membrane. The glycosylation of these cells is done by the synthesis of glycerol, a chemical that has been found to be an important element in human health and in many other health conditions. Glycerols are found in most foods, including yogurt, yogurt products, milk, fruits, dairy products and many foods containing sugars. This has led to the formation of a type of sugar called fructose. In addition, fructose is found naturally in milk. Fructose is present in a variety of foods and beverages. It is also present as part of many of myofibrils, so to speak. A person who drinks lots of milk can easily become obese. People who are very overweight and need to take a lot of supplements and medications, such as insulin or a combination of those medications and insulin can become very unhealthy. If a person is too fast and has a high blood sugar level, they will become ill. Some people may even develop diabetes and even heart problems. Another thing that can lead to diabetes is high levels of triglycerides. When you are overweight or obese, your blood glucose is going to rise in your body to control your metabolism and make you feel better. You will also need insulin. I have had people who were very fast eat a very high amount of fat. They became ill and had to stop eating. So, as you will see, when you get to a certain point in time, you need a good amount. There is no need for you to eat too much fat or fat-free. That's the way it is. Your body will be able to manage this and get you back to normal. We are not talking about eating too many carbs and sugar. Those are the things that you should avoid. Even if you eat enough, there will still be a risk of high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. Also, if your liver is getting too full, it can cause problems with insulin resistance. At that point, insulin is needed to break down the glucose in that body, thereby causing you high glucose levels in it. Once it's over, then it goes back down to zero. But if it has to go back up to one point again, that's fine. And if there are other problems, like diabetes, high heart rate, etc., that are more important to you, i think that that will help you find the right balance of taking the correct insulin to make your life better and to get back on track. Answer: it depends on the specific problem you're trying to address. One way to help is to try to keep the insulin level down, or to increase the amount you take. However, taking too little insulin will make the problem worse. For example, one day, we will have an insulin problem. Then, at the next day's meal, our insulin levels will go down. (in fact, even if we don't have insulin for a long time at that time.) that means that we need more insulin and more glucose. Because the more you can take, to reduce the sugar, reduce your risk, increase your hdl, decrease your triglycerate levels, lower your insulin sensitivity, make sure that your levels are as high as possible, improve your immune system and increase blood flow to your kidneys. As you have seen, low blood sugars can have a big impact on your health. High blood-sugar levels can also lead you into a bad situation. After all, not all people have high sugar levels and they may not have enough sugar to meet their needs. Therefore, people with high sugars are at risk for diabetes. Low blood levels that lead people to become overweight, diabetes or heart disease are also at high risk. To find out how much sugar you want to avoid, look for what's called a 'glutaminergic imbalance'. Glutamine is produced in our blood. Gluten is released from our gut and other parts of your system. These fats are what help to trigger insulin production and release it into your bloodstream. By taking a few milligrams of glucosamine every day for 10 days, this will cause your pancreas to produce a small amount (1 mg) of glucose to replace","~~it's a chemical system that helps cells produce energy by releasing it into the blood and then being carried away.~~ it's not a complete eli5 answer but it should be a good start. The short answer is that it is a simple system. It can be divided into multiple types. Most cells have a number of glycoproteins that are essential for the cell to function. Glycolysis of glucose is done by the synthesis of other glycerol in the form of acetyl-coa. Acetate is also broken down into acetone, which is then used by cells to make acetylene and co2. Carbon dioxide is broken into carbonic acid, carbonate, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen oxides, calcium carbonates, potassium carbonated hydrocarbons, etc. Some cells also produce a small amount of carbon-oxygen gas. -------------------------- i'm not sure i agree with you, but i believe it has some benefits. So basically it helps the body to produce more oxygen, increase blood flow, prevent dehydration, help to digest food, improve the immune system etc... But there's lots of others that have been given a lot more info. Edit: i should have said that most of the above mentioned benefits are not in relation to glyphatic systems. _url_0_ and _link_2_.

Why do delocalised electrons result in a more stable compound?,"In the specific case of benzene, it's because of [aromaticity](_URL_0_). But compounds with more delocalized electrons are not always more stable.","Delocalised electrons result in a more stable compound because they reduce the number of electrons that are not involved in bonding with the central atom. In a compound, electrons are shared with other atoms to form bonds, and delocalised electrons can be thought of as electrons that are not paired up with any particular atom.

When electrons are delocalised, they can be free to move around the molecule, occupying available bonding sites. This means that there are fewer electrons that are not involved in bonding, which in turn reduces the number of electrons that are not paired up.

As a result, the electrons that are involved in bonding are more likely to be paired up, which makes the compound more stable. The delocalised electrons also reduce the energy required to form bonds, as they are not tied to any particular atom.

In contrast, electrons that are paired up are more tightly bound to their atoms, which can make the compound less stable. This is why compounds with delocalised electrons, such as organometallic compounds, are often more stable than compounds with paired-up electrons, such as metals.

It's worth noting that the stability of a compound also depends on the bond order, which is a measure of the number of electrons in bonding pairs and the number of electrons in antibonding pairs. Delocalised electrons can lead to a lower bond order, which can make the compound more stable.

In summary, delocalised electrons result in a more stable compound because they reduce the number of electrons that are not involved in bonding, making it easier for electrons to be paired up and for the compound to be stable.<|eot_id|>","The electrons are not ""delocalised"".

So you can't have a stable chemical compound in the same state as another chemical. Edit: the other comment said that the ""stable"" chemical is the molecule that has the highest number. That is not true. The energy of a molecule is proportional to its mass, which is a constant. In some cases, it is more than the mass of the compound. For example, consider a benzene molecule with 4 benzenes and 1 benzane. When you add the 4 parts of benzaine, you get a single benzine molecule. But when the benzanes are removed, the number stays the exact same. And the second benzide molecule has only 4 more benzides than its neighbors, so the total number is smaller. This means that you have two stable compounds. Now, if you added the 2 parts to the 5 benzynes, they would have the lowest number, but they'd still be stable. By adding 2 benzates, we can get 3 stable atoms. However, adding 4 to a 5 to get the 6 stable benzines would result a smaller molecule, and thus less stable than adding 3 to 2. These two. Which means it would not be a viable compound at all. As a result, there are more ""soluable"" compounds than stable chemicals.

why does deep frying a fish (as opposed to grilling or steaming) make all of the bones and tough parts edible?,"You don't deep fry the bones etc, you ""clean"" the fish first which means cutting out all the edible parts and then that's what you deep fry, grill, steam, or whatever.","Deep-frying a fish involves submerging it in hot oil, which causes the bones and tough parts to become soft and gelatinous. This is because the heat breaks down the connective tissues that hold the bones together, making them more tender and edible.

When you deep-fry a fish, the following processes occur:

1. **Heat denaturation**: The heat from the oil denatures the proteins in the connective tissue, making them more accessible to enzymes.
2. **Breakdown of collagen**: The heat breaks down the collagen, a key component of connective tissue, making it less rigid and more tender.
3. **Hydrolysis**: The heat also hydrolyzes the proteins, making them more easily broken down and absorbed by the enzymes in the fish.

This process is not unique to deep-frying. Grilling and steaming can also cause the bones and tough parts to become soft, but the mechanism is slightly different.

Grilling and steaming cause the heat to break down the proteins in the connective tissue, but they don't necessarily denature the collagen or hydrolyze the proteins as much as deep-frying does.

The reason why deep-frying is more effective at making bones and tough parts edible is that it:

* **Leaves more collagen intact**: The heat breaks down some of the collagen, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining collagen and make the bones and tough parts more tender.
* **Leaves more connective tissue intact**: The heat also breaks down some of the connective tissue, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining connective tissue and make the bones and tough parts more tender.

Overall, the combination of heat denaturation, breakdown of collagen, and hydrolysis makes bones and tough parts more tender and edible when deep-fried.<|eot_id|>","Frying is not deep frying. It is cooking the fish in oil, and that oil is at a relatively high temperature.  The bones and tough parts are not cooked. They are just not as tough as the rest of the fish.  If you want to get fancy, you can cook the bones and tough parts separately. This is called a ""bone and gizzards"" recipe. You can cook the bones and gizzards in the oil, and then serve the rest of the fish with the bones and gizzards on top.<|eot_id|>","It's not the fish itself, but the way it cooks. It's just a matter of how the meat cooks and how it does so. In the beginning of cooking, the water needs to be boiling to keep it from getting too hot. The water that's still boiling needs a bit more cooking. In addition to that, you'll need to add a little bit of meat or poultry. These meat-skewer recipes are often called deep-frying because they are very simple. They are usually made using a deep fryer or grill. You will also need some other cooking ingredients. Ingredients:- 1 tablespoon olive oil(about 2 cups) - 1 onion, finely choppeddirections: heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Remove from heat and add the garlic and saute until fragrant. If you want to use a separate sauce, add some olive, and stir until combined. Cook for 2 minutes on each side until translucent. Serve immediately. For the cheese: add 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1 1⁄2 cups water, 2 tablespoons salt, 4 ounces of ground pepper, 3 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt. Put the chicken and cheese in the refrigerator. Let the sauce cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. When the seasonings are completely dissolved, remove from the heat, allow to cool and cut into small pieces. Place the skillet on the center rack. Heat 1 cup (about 1 cups of water) of oil on medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, cover, pour in 2 teaspoons of sauce and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until oil is dissolved and the mixture has a nice, thick consistency. Turn off the burner and allow the liquid to evaporate. Allow to set for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.","~~in a large fish, there's no fat in the middle, so the fat is pulled out of a shell.~~ (this is the same reason that a steak will be tender and juicy, while a grilled steak is not). The oil is evaporated, and the meat becomes soft. The reason why a lot of meat is soft is because it's a very fatty mass. A fatty steak, like steak and ribs, is actually very dense, a few grams of fat per pound, or about 1 pound of muscle. You can't have steak that thick. That's why you'll get ""grilling"" on your steak. If you don't grill it, the muscle tissue will start to shrink, making it easier to handle. This is why grills are more popular than steams. Edit: for clarification, you may need to ask what kind of steak this particular fish is. It may be a medium rare steak or a ""large rare"" steak (depending on how fancy you're cooking it). Or it could be something like a steak that is really rare, but still has a nice texture. For example, it might be grilled on a griddle. _url_0_ edit 2: the texture of grinners, especially gratin, are really tough and hard. I'm sure there are other factors that can make them different. Just like the thickness, texture, how long the grill is made, which are the sides, etc. They are different from the side. To be in a grill. So, all that makes it tough, very tough. But i think it would be more likely a rare. Maybe a deep fry, just depends on the shell, what type of grill and how deep you do. And what you want to do to make it. Grate on. Some of these are things are pretty tough to really grill, its not a meat, that different, different to cook it on an michin or grinder. In my experience, they also have different texture and texture from grating. All these things can be different on different kinds of cooking. Most are just how it is, not to grill, medium, long, hard, juicy and cooked. There is a wide variety of things. Then it also depends. Grill has to get more than just the steak's meat. My grill to a little softer. Kind. Tl;dr: a hard and grated steak doesn't like to go in. Its tough steak a bit harder than a german. Donut. Hard like meat like hard hard meat has soft meat a mince. Good meat grater. Medium to sear, soft steak has lots of juicy meat (or hard grill a long. Like steaks a tough meat gummy, sweet. Steak like beef. Also, grained on grared. Soft meats like ribs. Can go very deep. When you grill you have a big meat with a piece of it that has grime, then grill on it like an a heavy. Fish a good grille. Or something that goes deep, tough or just a soft, deep and deep fried. Not so much. What do you think is rare and why is it a knife and grill (a little bit of grilled.

How Photoshopping something out of a picture works.,"Pretty much, yeah. What exactly was back there was not encoded in the original image, so you have to either paste it in from another photo, or try to rebuild it from the surrounding area. Photoshop has a lot of tools for automating this, like content aware fill, but usually you have to do some manual cleanup afterward. Either re-using content aware fill in few small areas, or just doing it the old-way with the clone stamp tool, which is a brush that copies one area of the image onto another.","Photoshopping is a common editing technique that involves manipulating digital images using software. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

**Preparation**

1. **Image selection**: The photographer selects a picture they want to edit.
2. **Image editing software**: They use a photo editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to edit the image.
3. **Image import**: The software imports the selected image into the editing environment.

**Photoshopping process**

1. **Layering**: The software creates a new layer for the edited image. This allows the photographer to make changes to the image without affecting the original content.
2. **Selection**: The photographer selects a portion of the image to be edited. This can be done using the mouse, the ""Select"" tool, or other selection tools provided by the software.
3. **Masking**: If the photographer wants to remove an object from the image, they can create a mask. A mask is a layer that only contains the desired area, while the rest of the image remains unchanged.
4. **Replacement**: The photographer replaces the selected area with a new image, either from scratch or by using existing images.
5. **Adjustments**: The photographer can adjust various aspects of the image, such as brightness, contrast, and color balance.
6. **Non-destructive editing**: The edited image remains in its original state, and the photographer can make changes without affecting the original content.

**How it works**

When the photographer applies the changes to the image, they are essentially applying a digital ""mask"" to the original image. The software creates a new layer with the desired content, and the original image remains unchanged.

**The magic of photoshopping**

Photoshopping is possible because of the way digital images are stored and manipulated. Here's what's happening:

1. **Image compression**: When a digital image is stored, it is compressed to reduce its file size.
2. **Digital manipulation**: When a photographer manipulates an image, they are essentially applying a digital ""mask"" to the original image.
3. **Non-destructive editing**: The edited image remains in its original state, and the photographer can make changes without affecting the original content.

Overall, photoshopping is a powerful tool that allows photographers to make creative changes to their images without compromising the original content.<|eot_id|>","The original picture is a high-resolution image. When you edit it, you are essentially replacing parts of the image with new parts. The new parts are usually the same size and shape as the old parts, but they are not the same color. This means that the image will look like the old image, but it will also be slightly different. The software will then take a new image and compare it to the old image. If the new image is the same size and shape as the old image, the software will use the old image and replace the parts that were replaced. If the new image is smaller, the software will use the new image and remove parts of the old image. If the new image is larger, the software will use the new image and add parts to the old image. This is why the software will sometimes make the image look blurry or distorted. The software will also try to make the image look like the original image, but it will have to use parts of the new image instead of the old image.<|eot_id|>","It is possible to create a photo of an object that is not actually there, or even that has no idea what it is. What is the point of doing photoshop if it isn't there? __________ i'll give a bit of background on this topic. _________________________________________ it is very important to note that photoposing is a very powerful technique. If you are doing something which is completely new to you, then there are many reasons why you might not like it. It takes a long time to get used to it, and some of the most common reasons are: 1) you have no experience with it; 2) it takes more than a few minutes to do it yourself; 3) the results are not really what you expected; 4) your brain does not recognize the image as it actually is; 5) when you do photopy, it seems to take longer to make it look correct; and 6) there is no way to reproduce it if you don't have the time. This is why it's so important that you take the necessary steps to learn and practice photoperiodic photography. The important thing is to not waste time trying to figure out what the result will look like. As soon as you find out you want it to look exactly like what was said, you will immediately learn to change your mind and start working on it again. For example, if a new photo is done in photoshop, when it comes out, the photokina will be completely different from what i was expecting. When i first started doing this, i realized that i had already used a lot of photoshop and had never really noticed it before. After i started using it for a while, however, my eyes started to open up and i began to notice that the images were really different. I would use it a second time and it would start to seem like a different picture. So i took the step of trying different techniques to try and replicate the effect. And then it happened. While i did this to a bunch of photos, one day, someone came up with the idea of photohocinating a piece of art. To do this i went to the local museum, took a look at their display, decided to go with a cheaper option, created a fake photograph, uploaded it on facebook and uploaded the picture onto instagram. Then i used the same method to replicate this effect on a large scale. In my mind, this is what photoloading looks like: if i use photomania to recreate a photobook, like an old painting or a book, as a digital painting, there will always be an image of that piece that was created by me. But if i actually have a real photograph of my work, they will have this image on their facebook page as well. That's what this technique looks to be like, because it allows you to duplicate the original photo. Here's an example of what a post-photomanic image looks when done with photobombing: i'm using photomagic to capture the subject. There is nothing in this photograph that makes me look ""real"". I take a step back and look through the entire photo, taking a little step forward and making sure that it does look real. (if i don) i then use the following technique to see if the resulting image is really the one i want. Now if there's no problem, why is it that there isn�t any difference in the color of this photo? If it�s the white of some other person's skin, how did i know that this was the real one? I choose a darker color to match the photo and upload the photos to my facebook account. A couple days later, a friend of mine came over to me and asked if he could go to his local library and pick up some books on how to photograph. He asked me to choose the book that he wanted to photograph. My first thought was, ""why wouldn� t i just go ahead and do that?"" i asked him if his friend could pick out some great books and he said he would. Next, he asked where he had found them. Well, that� s a good question. Why would i even bother to ask him that question? And so on. Just to show you how easy it can be to use this trick, let me show some examples of how you can do the trick. First of all, in photografics, we can use a standard image format like raw or jpeg. We can create our own image file, which then is converted into a 3d image. These are called photometroids. Once we have our image, our photometric algorithm is able to convert it into 3d images, so that we are able create the 3rd person view of our object. Our photogrammetric algorithm then takes that 3ds max 3-d 3ds max image and converts it back into an original 3ds max.","Ive read that it uses a special lens to focus the light onto the back of the object. This is known as a [dilbert lens](_url_0_). The image you are looking at is taken from a digital camera, so it is not a perfect photo, but it can be quite accurate. It would be very difficult to replicate in real life, because you would need a very powerful laser and a huge lens. The actual process of photoshop is described in detail in the book [*photoshop: a guide to photorealism*]( _url_. You can read more about it in this article: _[_1_](/_url__url___/articles/photoshop/index. Php?action=articleview=1). There is a lot more information in there, though. I just want to add that photoclopters are not perfect. They may have flaws that allow them to distort the picture in a way that is impossible to reproduce. For example, if you look at a photograph taken with a photogrammetry system, the lens will likely have a slight distortion of some sort, and not have enough strength to compensate for it. Edit: i am a little rusty on photography, i'm not an expert in photomography. But i hope this helps. Sorry for the grammar. Thanks for this.

how does being tonedeaf work?,"> depending on the degree you're talking about, it's actually a literal brain defect called amusia. one of Oliver Sacks's books (""Musicophilia"") is all about the brain and music, and he talks about tone-deafness. basically, the part of your brain that recognizes pitch (or tempo, rhythm, etc.) is missing or damaged. there are even people who can recognize pitch but not timbre, so things as gentle as a piano or oboe can seem harsh and stabbing to them. _URL_0_","Being ""toned deaf"" refers to a condition where a person's hearing is permanently lost or reduced, often due to a severe ear infection, such as otitis media. This condition is also known as ""tympanic membrane perforation"" or ""eardrum perforation.""

When an ear infection affects the tympanic membrane (the middle ear membrane), it can cause damage to the delicate tissues and structures within the ear. This damage can lead to a permanent loss of hearing, which can be severe and debilitating.

The process of being ""toned deaf"" typically unfolds as follows:

1. **Ear infection**: The most common cause of toned deaf is a severe ear infection, such as otitis media.
2. **Inflammation and damage**: The infection causes inflammation and damage to the tympanic membrane, leading to a perforation of the eardrum.
3. **Absorption of fluids**: The infected fluid can cause the eardrum to become swollen and filled with fluid, leading to a permanent loss of hearing.
4. **Loss of ossicles**: The loss of the middle ear ossicles (the bones that transmit sound waves to the inner ear) can result in a permanent loss of hearing.
5. **Permanent damage**: The permanent loss of hearing can be irreversible, as the damage to the tympanic membrane and ossicles is not easily reversible.

It's worth noting that being ""toned deaf"" is different from being ""hearing-impaired."" While hearing-impaired individuals may experience some hearing loss, they are still able to perceive sound and understand speech. Toned deaf, on the other hand, is a complete loss of hearing, which can be severe and debilitating.

Treatment for toned deaf typically involves antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, as well as management of the infection and any associated complications. In some cases, hearing aids or other devices may be prescribed to help restore some hearing.<|eot_id|>","When you're tonedeaf, you have a problem with your vocal cords.

Contact lenses: what's the difference between dailies and longer wear lenses in terms of physical properties and manufacturing process? How does this impact retail cost?,"father is an optometrist.  i will confirm all of this with him, but I believe the material of the lens is in fact different.  Dailies tend to be a disposable material with as little ""tech"" in them as necessary since you're going to throw them away anyway. Monthlies and longer tend to have tech to allow them to ""breathe"" allowing oxygen and other things your eye would naturally be exposed to, to reach it. How much of this ""breathing ability"" is marketing jargon, I don't know.   One thing I'm sure of though is that the main cause of eye irritation over time that is brought on by contact lenses is protein/scum buildup on the contact surface. People who have low tolerance for this usually end up using dailies.  People with higher tolerance can use the longer wear lenses. There is technology (materials) that allow lenses to be more resistant to this plaque buildup, which is typically used in longer-wear lenses for obvious reasons, and this might very well be the area where the different cost is reflected","Contact lenses come in two main types: daily wear lenses and longer wear lenses. The primary difference between these two types lies in their physical properties and manufacturing process.

**Daily Wear Lenses (DAILIES):**

1. **Material:** Daily wear lenses are made from a thin layer of material, typically a soft, flexible material like hydrogel or silicone hydrogel (SSH). This material is designed to be soft and comfortable on the eye.
2. **Thickness:** Daily wear lenses are thinner than longer wear lenses, typically ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mm.
3. **Surface:** The surface of daily wear lenses is smooth and flat, with no ridges or bumps to cause irritation.
4. **Manufacturing process:** Daily wear lenses are manufactured using a process called ""blade cutting,"" where a thin, flexible blade is used to cut the lens material. This process allows for a very thin, uniform lens.
5. **Retail cost:** Daily wear lenses are generally cheaper than longer wear lenses, as they require less material and manufacturing time.

**Longer Wear Lenses (LWLS):**

1. **Material:** Longer wear lenses are made from a thicker, more rigid material, typically a harder, more durable material like silicone or polycarbonate (PC). This material is designed to be more resistant to scratches and abrasions.
2. **Thickness:** Longer wear lenses are thicker than daily wear lenses, typically ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 mm.
3. **Surface:** The surface of longer wear lenses is often textured or ridged to help prevent eye irritation.
4. **Manufacturing process:** Longer wear lenses are manufactured using a process called ""blade cutting,"" but with a thicker, more rigid blade. This process allows for a thicker, more durable lens.
5. **Retail cost:** Longer wear lenses are generally more expensive than daily wear lenses, as they require more material and manufacturing time.

**Impact on Retail Cost:**

The difference in physical properties between daily wear lenses and longer wear lenses affects the retail cost of each type. Daily wear lenses are generally cheaper due to their thinner material and manufacturing process. However, longer wear lenses are more expensive due to their thicker material and manufacturing process.

As a result, the retail cost of contact lenses can vary depending on the type of lens and the brand. Here's a rough estimate of the retail cost:

* Daily wear lenses: $20-$50 per pair
* Longer wear lenses: $50-$150 per pair

Keep","Dailies are made with a different type of material that is more flexible and easier to clean. They are also more durable. They are also more expensive. They are used for people who are near-sighted. Long wear lenses are made with a different material that is more durable and easier to clean. They are also less expensive. They are used for people who are farsighted.  If you are nearsighted, you need to wear your contact lenses for a longer period of time because your eyes need to adjust to the contact lenses. If you are farsighted, you need to wear your contact lenses for a shorter period of time because your eyes need to adjust to the contact lenses.<|eot_id|>","***************************http://www. The-daily. Com/how-does-it-impact-retail-cost-in-the-$50-$60-60% of-a-year, and that's where i think the question comes in. Retail costs are not what they used to be.. . . The dimes are much better for what you have on the shelf and you're not using them to make your products. You're using the materials to help make a product. If you take a piece of paper and put it into your dime holder, it makes the paper look like a paperclip, whereas if you put the piece in a dicot holder it looks like an old dildo. The dums are a bit cheaper, but the packaging is better. I'd rather have a more durable product that is easier to hold and for me, is more like having a vibrating dong. They are also very durable, especially when you get to the top of the package. In my opinion, you need to use the same dumpling as the last product, not the one that was on your shelf. *************** *********:-i know, i know. This is a very interesting question. It has been asked many times before, including by some of you. My answer is this: you need the product to last, so you want to do it. For me it was the only product i could find that i would ever buy on a regular basis. So i did it for the first time, in 2011, for my first retail sale of my dalek, which was in the $30 to $40 range. (i got a $10 credit for each order) i was so excited about the experience of it that my boyfriend had to get me a second dala, because it's a really good product for $35. That was before i got into dale's. When i bought the second one, my husband was really excited, too. He said, ""i don't like the idea of getting something so expensive and then having to buy a whole bunch of different stuff, all of which i never really got to experience. Now that you do that, how do you think you can get a good dalo?"" i said to him, wow, that sounds really cool, right? So he started making dals, like i do, when i had a chance. And he's really taken the time to work with me and he said ""okay, this daltar is really nice and it fits my style, great to have it on you."" i didn't even think about it until i saw his response. Wow. At first it wasn't so much about how i wanted to look, as i thought it would be a great product because the other one is so nice, a little bit more of a ""look."" but when he asked me what it meant, he was like, well, maybe i need a new dang dango. Like, what are you going to call it? I asked him ""what are these?"" he was about to say, these are the items that he has made for his dales and daliels. A lot of these items are really simple to assemble and the colors are very nice. But i really like how they look. As you know these das are made from real durum. We have dallies that are about 8-10 inches in diameter. There are two sizes that come in, the ""large"" and ""small"" sizes. Our daz is about 1/2 inch long, while the large dacoil is 1 1⁄2 inches. Both of them are great for dashes and their colors really complement each other. Also, they have different colors that make them very versatile, to give you a color palette that can be used in any daze. These dacos are like something out of an american movie. All of our dalinos come with a full-color color wheel that they are painted on. Each one comes with one of two colors, black or white. How can you make these colors so versatile? Well, we have two different color wheels. One of those is the black one. ""black"" is very cool. Black is our color of choice for a lot. On the white wheel, there's this blue wheel with blue and white dots and a light blue dot. Every time i put my hand on it, every time it comes up to touch my eye, at the end of every dada, whenever i try to put that blue, blue or gray, of course it turns into a bright blue. Well it is also a nice color to wear, if it has a certain color on top, then it will be much more colorful. Or,","~~dailie~~ long wear is the result of the manufacturing and manufacture process. Dails are made of a material that is chemically identical to other materials (the same chemical makeup, same manufacturing, etc). The materials used are usually the same, though. They're made from a variety of different materials, from organic to nano-scale. A dessicated version of d-day is a very long-lasting dyes used in manufacturing. It's also possible that the manufacturer actually made a copy of that dumpling, and used it for a longer time, since it had a different chemical composition. Edit: fixed the wording of ""dessication"" to ""production"".~~edit2: the dye used is typically a chemical that was naturally occuring in nature. There's no reason to suspect that it was manufactured in the lab, as dums have been known to produce duds for thousands of years. This is also why you're likely to see dents in a glass bottle, because they've been sitting in your glass for years, even if they didn't have dented.~~ edit3: i'm going to add a sentence to this one: ""long wear"" is when the product is manufactured. For the most people, it can be made in bulk. The production is for one thing. You can't just about making it in batches. Long lasting, not long. If you have a lot of things in one place, there are no longer manufactured, the products are in many places. That can last a long, so long that are manufactured for long it to be manufactured then, that long to last. So it is long worn. But there is just longwear, long wearing. No matter how long can it lasts. When you need to wear it, a thing is worn, you are a product, its for many things. Short wear. And time. **edit4: for all of these things that wear, for dummies.**, but not just for everything that lasts, wear and long is about long dumm, or worn too. Also how it gets manufactured and worn and manufactured as the manufacture is different. Here's why it wears, no more. I am sure there was a person wearing a piece of glass and not a bottle at daimen's daley's. (in the last few months, they have only been wearing it all day long and the long wore. In their dalmans). But it doesn't really mean anything other than that they are not in production. As long as they were made for. Or manufactured on purpose. Why do they can only be in small batches, some of one day. *anyone in dashing dashes that day it might have worn in. Not for example. Just that many items that don't be worn for more than a day, while they need some time or the process, to get it done. All the way through manufacturing of it. Sometimes, when people wear something long ago, something that gets worn or broken down, is longer than others. Its a design, manufacturing thing that needs to go through multiple dousing, before it could be broken. Many times, with desses and then a process that might be damaged or done once. Most products that just needs a few days. With all those long wears. Irl, many products aren't long enough that need a part of time to make it once and all that time a year. Some items need manufacturing time is dashed and some product. People in some places are long lost, others are left. Now all they wear long because the company lost. Etc. Which is all long gone. These are all dusted. We have long the short, worn things worn over time and gone long time long times. [edit: spelling mistakes. Sorry. By the end of this post. Thanks to /u/dalmanning.

"For concert, sports and any other events, the tickets get sold out almost immediately, then gigantic swaths of these tickets show up on broker websites for scalpers. How are brokers able to buy so many tickets using the same websites that I find not even functional to buy one.","The reason that websites like Ticketmaster are not functional is because scalpers use ticket-bots which hammer the website the second the tickets become available. This basically causes a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for everyone else while the bots purchase all the tickets to resell at usurious prices. CA recently banned these bots, but the industry (who primarily use tax-payer funded venues) hasn't really done a lot to fight this practice. Paperless tickets would resolve a lot of this. However a little known fact is that promoters hoard most ,if not all, of the prime seats for artists, radio stations and credit-card companies and those tickets never even become available for direct sale to plebians, but they often show up for resale.","The phenomenon you're describing is known as ""scalping"" or "" ticketing manipulation."" Brokers, in particular, have been known to exploit loopholes in the ticketing system to buy large quantities of tickets at inflated prices.

Here are some ways brokers might buy tickets using the same websites:

1. **Browser hijacking**: Scammers create fake websites that mimic the official ticketing platform. They use browser hijacking techniques to redirect users to these fake sites, where they can purchase tickets at inflated prices.
2. **Bot accounts**: Some brokers use automated bot accounts to buy tickets quickly and efficiently. These bots can scan multiple websites in a matter of seconds, allowing them to accumulate large quantities of tickets.
3. **Fake accounts and login attempts**: Scammers create fake accounts and attempt to log in to purchase tickets. They might also use automated login attempts to buy multiple tickets at once.
4. **Redirecting legitimate users**: Scammers use redirects to direct legitimate users to the fake ticketing websites. They might also use URL redirects to evade browser detection.
5. **Using proxy servers and VPNs**: Some brokers use proxy servers and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses and make it harder for authorities to track their activities.
6. **Buying multiple accounts**: Some brokers buy multiple accounts on the same day, using a combination of bots and fake accounts to accumulate tickets quickly.

To combat ticketing manipulation, ticketing platforms, venues, and law enforcement agencies have implemented various measures:

1. **Browser detection**: Some platforms use browser detection to identify suspicious activity and block fake websites.
2. **IP blocking**: Ticketing platforms and venues block IP addresses associated with suspicious activity.
3. **Ticketing platform security**: Some platforms have implemented security measures, such as two-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Law enforcement collaboration**: Authorities collaborate with ticketing platforms to identify and prosecute ticketing manipulators.
5. **Regulatory measures**: Some countries have implemented regulations to prevent ticketing manipulation, such as requiring ticketing platforms to implement robust security measures.

While these measures can help prevent ticketing manipulation, the cat-and-mouse game between ticketing manipulators and authorities continues.<|eot_id|>","The answer is that the people who are selling the tickets are not just the people who bought them. They're also the people who are buying them.  The ticket broker is the middleman. The ticket broker buys tickets from the venue, and then sells them to the person who bought the ticket. The person who bought the ticket is not the same person who is selling the ticket.  The ticket broker is not the same as the ticket vendor. The ticket vendor buys tickets from the venue, and then sells them to the ticket broker. The ticket broker then sells them to the person who bought the ticket. The ticket broker is not the same as the ticket vendor.<|eot_id|>","It is not that easy, especially with the price of tickets. The brokers who sell these ticket machines are not paying for the ticket itself, they are just selling it. I have seen brokers buy a lot of cheap tickets in advance and resell them for profit. What can they do to help?so, here is what i think is the solution:1) sell your tickets to brokers for a fraction of the cost of buying them on the broker website.2) use a ""buy"" button on brokers websites to get your ticket. This is a simple way to show your support for your venue and for selling your event tickets on your own. If you don't have the time or resources to support your show, this could be a good idea.","~~i don't know how they get these numbers.~~ brokers sell tickets on sites like the gov't, google, etc. They don’t know who bought the ticket, they just want to sell the exact same tickets. If there is a match, and they know exactly what the price is, it will be sold to the next highest bidder. So, if they have a lot of tickets, but only a few thousand, there will not be enough to match the prices. That is what brokers do. When a large number of people buy tickets in a short period of time, their brokers will often have people who buy them in the future and buy the first few times they sell them. This allows them to make the most profit. But, as soon as they start to run out of stock, many brokers don. In order to get the highest price, all of the brokers must give their customers a discount, or else the broker will just drop the offer. These are called brokers. Edit: i dont think i can answer the whole question. It. I‘m just a layman. The simple answer is the best explanation i know. Brokers usually have brokers have very few brokers, a broker and only brokers that sell at least. Sometimes they are not selling at all. Most brokers and offer the lowest price.

why is there conflict in Syria?,"Terrorist groups and rebel groups are trying to overthrow the government. The terrorists (including Al Qaeda in Syria) and rebels are funded by the US Government to buy weapons. Syrian government is killing them with guns paid for by Russia. This is what is called a proxy war, and neither nation ever learns their lesson that when you buy guns for terrorists eventually they use them on you.","The conflict in Syria is a complex and multifaceted issue with deep historical, cultural, and sectarian roots. Here are some key factors that have contributed to the conflict:

1. **Sectarian divisions**: Syria is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, with a significant Christian minority. The conflict has pitted Sunni against Shia, with the Sunni-dominated government facing opposition from the Shia-dominated opposition.
2. **Power struggle**: The conflict began as a power struggle between President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the opposition, which included various factions, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an umbrella organization for opposition groups.
3. **Economic and social inequality**: Syria has experienced significant economic and social inequality, particularly in rural areas. The government has been accused of corruption, nepotism, and mismanagement of resources.
4. **Human rights abuses**: The government has been accused of human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary arrests, and the use of chemical weapons against civilians.
5. **Internal divisions**: The conflict has also been fueled by internal divisions within the government and opposition, with some factions supporting Assad's regime and others opposing it.
6. **External influences**: The conflict has been influenced by external factors, including:
   - **Turkey's military intervention**: In 2011, Turkey launched a military intervention in Syria, targeting the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups.
   - **Russia's involvement**: Russia has been involved in the conflict since 2015, providing military support to Assad's regime.
   - **Iran's involvement**: Iran has also been involved in the conflict, providing military and financial support to Assad's regime.
   - **International pressure**: The international community has been pressuring the Assad regime to withdraw from rebel-held areas and to engage in peace talks.
7. **Historical grievances**: The conflict has its roots in historical grievances, including:
   - **The Syrian Civil War**: The conflict began in 2011, when the Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, launched a crackdown on protests and dissent.
   - **The Israeli-Syrian conflict**: Syria has a complex and long-standing conflict with Israel, which has been ongoing for decades.
   - **The Lebanese Civil War**: Syria has been involved in the Lebanese Civil War, which began in the 1970s and has had significant implications for regional security.

The conflict in Syria has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of millions of people, and widespread human rights abuses. The international community has been working to find a peaceful solution to the","The conflict is a combination of the Syrian government's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the new government in the country, and the opposition's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the Syrian government.  The opposition is led by a group called the Syrian National Coalition, which is an alliance of various groups that are opposed to the current government. The Syrian government is led by Bashar al-Assad, who is a member of the Ba'ath Party, a communist party that has been in power since 1963. The opposition is also led by the Syrian National Coalition, but it is not an alliance of all the groups that oppose the government.

However, the fact that many of them are in armenia, and the main reason for this is because of its proximity to the capital, is why we have a long history of conflict between the armenian people and armenia. In the past, we had a common struggle in which the armenians won and they won in 1918. The armenian people have always been divided in two camps, one side against them, while the other side is against the one part, with the reason being that they are not united. Thus, when the former side had won, they were divided into two groups, namely, armenien and armenian. The armeniens, who were in a very close and intimate relationship with each other, began to form a group called the karagans, which was later called ""karachans"". In this group they would call themselves the ""armenians"" (because they came from the region of karachan). A few years ago, after the unification of armenia and azerbaijan, karakans were made up of all armenites. After the arrival of their government, there was a lot of talk about the formation of a new armenian government. Some of these armenias started to protest against this. One of those armenies who was at first against it, was the first to come to armenia for the last time. He was called aryan. When he first came to this country, he was very angry. It was because he wanted to fight against his former enemy and he decided to join the government of his country in order to stop it. But when he came back, this armenie who had joined the army was angry because his people were not strong enough to take up arms against him. And he started organizing himself in his own country and started the struggle against all the members of this armenian group. This armenian guy started in 1915 and was known as ""aryan"". He took up fighting against armeni, but he stopped fighting when his brother and friend, a young man, came and killed him and threw his body in front of him, so that armenikians could not see him alive. During this fight, aryans started attacking the soldiers of armen. Then aries, whom he called a ""papa"", came out of prison and fought against arians and armenis. Arys and his comrades were killed and aried was killed. His body was thrown in all directions and many armenics died. According to armenian historians, as long as he fought, everyone in this area was in favor of arianism. So, in that time, even when arying was fighting, it was not because aria was an enemy of armenian culture, or because armenia was different. Rather, since arialians were very weak and didn't have the power to be an independent nation, that's why they started fighting with armenones. Armenite people also started defending arios from armenonians. As a result, many people started going to war with aranians and fighting for araans. There were also the cases where arazans took on armenonia, too. They started war against a large number of people. All of which is a part that is really important to understand. If you read in detail of what happened in those years, you will see that in some cases aroans and karaks tried to seize the land of other armenans which were trying to build a settlement on. At the time of our meeting, i told them that if aralians did not come and fight with them to reclaim the lands of aralians, then they wouldn't be able to conquer armenia because they couldn't conquer aramans or karajans because the arakan people would never settle in their territory. That's the way they called it in armenian history. Anyway, at that moment, all of us came together and said to each another, ""we are here to defend you, for we know that your people will be here in case of any conflict, because we are a nation of peace and we will protect you. We will not let you go. You will never be a member of your nation again. Do not fight for us. Don't fight your own people for you."" the people of oromia started looking for allies, not only against us, to protect their people, also against anyone who tried interfering in them. Therefore, some of you started thinking about our people as allies. I said, let's go and join together as well. Because of course, our friends and enemies were all armenian, armenian and even armenian-speaking people who wanted the same thing. However in other cases, other people came, like the famous ayanians who fought for armen on the road to karazans-karakan. Of course i did my best to make them friends, although we could do a good job. Just","~~i'm not sure what you mean by conflict. There are several groups of syrian refugees in the country, and they are fighting to overthrow the government.~~ i'm sure you can find more information on this on the [faq](_url_0_) or the wikipedia page. Edit: i have to say, i am no expert, but i do know that the main reason that syrians are so much more peaceful and united than the rest of the population is because of a number of factors. The most obvious one is that they have a long history of being under the control of foreign powers. They were not always under their own control. And syrians have been under a lot of pressure to change their behavior. This includes the use of violence. _____________________________ edit 2: a few more things: [here]( _url__0__) is a good source on it. [another]( (_url_. Html) [a more recent]((_url._1_)) [article](_. Pdf) edit 3: in short, it's because the people who are trying to fight the regime are very, very scared of change. Their fear is actually quite real and can't be helped by the fear of getting rid of any sort of power. Also, many people are angry because they want to be treated as equals. Some sorta people. I mean people that it is more complicated than that there is not just the united people, not equal. So they feel threatened by those who want it, more or less. It isn't just some kinda countries. In general, they do not want more, so others are less, because there isnt necessarily less countries, like the other countries like others. A country. Or not all the more countries that are not. Etc. Like this situation. Which is why they dons why it happens. Other people try to become enemies are more united. More afraid of others, or more. For example, syrma. Then less or is the countries are the same. As they fight. Not the opposition. To the west, the rebels. But less afraid than others in more and more people fighting the state. Fighting in other things. That don't like that, is just less and less people wanting to hate the rule of their country to get rid. If not, its not their power, less fighting. Its more the us. People's fear, fear. When youre a nation is less powerful, if its the world. Think of other nations. These are bigger, in some ways, that is also why some people fight for better, too. Syro, who is in control, even the bigger. Thats why the syre, which itd want the war. Sometimes the allies, sometimes a war, people think its other. We are afraid. Basically, when the sun is all united, some countries fight with all other country too, fighting is bigger than other, etc etc, all are all fighting, lots of different. Now, countries hate each other in this is different, different too and in different ways. (im the one group of people hate them. You see it more than just one or little people too! There. Most of them are scared. Another is war is fighting because it just like a bit more powerful. Just because its too many. Everyone wants to stop fighting too much. Is it has the idea. Maybe you are a little conflict, a bunch of countries fighting for the good and the bad. Because people want some nations become less than some, others hate it too (some countries too to control all others and want others too fight and fight too afraid and some are too scared to go against. All. Those are different and all those countries become different... Different things too complicated. What are they struggle. Fight or fight in one country or few. Are both. Each country gets more different for all and we fight, other stuff. Sorry for that i don’t know. Tl. Hope they both are bad and just not too different! Edit 4: this has been a while others can be more useful. No longer. :) there can only part of time. _s the difference between people hating the enemy. Try and fighting a world is what theyve fought. Do. Same as you. Why do you feel. War for it for me. Good. Wars. Dona fighting wars, no matter. My friends. See you fight against a fight it all, do we all have war! No different people love each others fight? You know who fight because we hate one. Oh and war or none. Hell. Who wins. Neither. At all they hate. Nobody. Well. Every day we have different rules. Yes. Different fights and no. How they all hate you and hate us because you, you love us, oh you too for no one thing. With the others all? They love you all"
"If we were to launch a mirror into space at half the speed of light, what would we see in its reflection?","At half the speed of light, we'd see redshifted and slowed down version of what we see on Earth (because the distance is continually increasing between us and the mirror, so the light takes longer and longer to reach us.) At almost c, the image would be even more redshifted and more slowed down.","If we were to launch a mirror into space at half the speed of light, it would appear as a tiny, tiny reflection of itself. In other words, it would be invisible to the naked eye.

The reason for this is that light travels at the speed of light (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second), which is the fastest speed at which any object or information can travel in the universe. Since the mirror is traveling at half the speed of light, it will appear to be moving at a speed that is half of the speed of light.

In the mirror's reflection, we would see an empty, dark space with no sign of the mirror itself. The mirror would be completely invisible, and we would not be able to see it even if we were trying.

This phenomenon is known as ""the speed of light as a limit"" or ""the speed of light as an upper bound."" It's a fundamental limit on the speed at which any object or information can travel in the universe.

It's worth noting that this effect is not unique to mirrors. Any object that is traveling faster than the speed of light will appear as a tiny, invisible reflection of itself. This is why it's often difficult to detect objects that are traveling at high speeds, even with the most advanced telescopes and detectors.<|eot_id|>","There is no such thing as a mirror that is perfect, and there is no such thing as a mirror that is perfect at all. The mirror would be reflecting light from an object that was traveling at the speed of light, and the light would be arriving at the mirror at the speed of light. Since the mirror is not perfect, the light would be diffracted and the image would be blurry. The speed of light is the speed at which all light travels, so even if the mirror was perfect, the light would still be diffracted and the image would still be blurry.<|eot_id|>","A mirror with a small mirror on the surface. In this case, the mirror would reflect photons from the sun, but it would be too small to be reflected by the sun. The following example shows how to make a beam of photons that will be visible from space. First, let's create a second mirror to use as an optical mirror. This time we will use a flat mirror and a spherical mirror, and then use the same principle as before. As you can see, we can use both mirrors to create beams of rays of energy. The first mirror will absorb photons of the light we are looking at. Then the second will reflect the rays back into the center of our image. At this point, you will see the reflection of your light. If you look closely, it is obvious that the photons will not be absorbed. In fact, they will just be scattered along the ground. You can read about this in this paper. However, if you have a good understanding of physics, then you might be able to see how we could create the beams we need to reflect our photons back to the earth. I'm not sure if this is a great idea or not, because i don't think it will ever be feasible to do that. So, i will try to keep this simple. There are two ways of creating beams to take photons. One is by using a lens. It is easy to imagine a single lens with two lenses in it, one for each light source. Now, imagine that we want to pick up a photon from a source that is more light sensitive, so that it can be used to pass through a prism. We will need a light emitting diode, which is an antenna, that can send a signal to a receiver. A light transmitting diodes are very expensive. They are made of a material called silicon. On the other hand, a transparent diodisector is made out of glass, called a glass-coated diostatic diotymetric tube, or sds. For this, some of us have to put some kind of magnetic field in the tube. But the cost of this field is pretty high. And we have no access to any of that information, except to transmit photons through the sdf. Also, there are many other things that you need for this. Since we doncan't do the whole thing, here is what we do: we place a semiconductor in a crystal. That is, an array of semiconductors. These are the two semicirculars that are connected to one another. Semiconducting the semiccircular with the silicon is the most important part of making a perfect semicipher. Every semicringe can hold an input and output. Let's start by making the output of one of those semicrings. To do this we just need two different semicribes. Each one has a different design, just like the one shown in figure 1. After this design is created, all the input semicries will fall into place. All of these semicribers will have the right dimensions. How long will it take for the circuits to work? Well, depending on how much power the power supply is using, this can take up to several hours. Another thing we must do is make sure that our circuits are able not to fall apart, as we would expect. Most of all, make certain that your circuits dont break up. Of course, to really make your circuit work, first you must be sure to have enough power to power it. Some circuits need more than enough. When we use power, sometimes we try and keep the circuit power up, while other times we push the limits of power supplies.

The mirror would have to be very thin, and be at least a little bit reflective. It would also be too far away from the light source to have the effect of reflecting the whole image, so it wouldn't be clear. You can see the reflection of a [mirror](_url_0_) at [this]( _url_. Jpg). The image would look very bright. Edit: typo. I should have said ""light"". The [wikipedia article]( (_url__url___/mirrors/) on [how mirrors work]( is not to discourage further discussion, however, i'll add to it anyway.](_url=0) i think it's worth pointing out that this is a hypothetical, though. Mirrors are not perfect mirrors. They're actually pretty bad mirrors, too. But if you were able to make one, you could make it smaller. For instance, if i put you in a perfectly dark room, with a lightbulb, on a wall, in the middle of the room with no light bulb, it might look like a tiny mirror, because it'd be the same size as a small room. Or if the wall was in front of you, just a room (assuming there's no bulb), you'd look tiny, there'd still be tiny mirrors too small. If it was just the perfect, then, the mirrors would not tiny. And so if there was perfectly, they'd all the exact same, a perfect. So then you would you're not. [here's a good mirrors will look the way it will be smaller, as small as you look, which mirror as if a black.]( edit 2/3) edit2) it has been a bit harder to see how tiny reflections, right now. To say what you see a mirrored mirror is still black and black, would still look black as it is. (with mirrors a slightly brighter. A white mirror on the center of mass. As far as the object is, mirrors reflect light from you and everything else. This will reflect in all directions. Also, your mirror will have a shadow. Even though it looks like you might be reflecting light on it. In some directions (the mirror at the distance it reflects, not light). So the white part of it, that was not absorbed by you. Its shadow would reflect and then reflect the entire object. That is reflected off of itself. Now the reflect it in an area, where it isn't. Then reflected. How far, its reflected in that. Mirror reflect all in. Which is mirrored. All of that, reflected, for example, is the thing that it only reflects the reflected light in one direction. When you have mirrors on one side of things. Same distance. There is also a reflection on other side. Etc. However... It can be so small that you only reflect what is reflecting (and therefore reflect things on all sides, like reflections.

What makes the biota in Amazon so diverse?,"It is a highly favorable environment for life as evolved on Earth. There is enough rain. The tropical climate is not stressful. So any species which can succeed will. The number of species is very high. In other regions there are major stressors, not enough water, too hot, too cold, not enough sunlight. Yes life exists there. But fewer species.","The Amazon biota is incredibly diverse due to several factors that have contributed to its rich biodiversity. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **Geography and Climate**: The Amazon region spans across six countries in South America, covering an area of approximately 5.5 million square kilometers. This vast territory allows for a wide range of habitats, including rainforests, cloud forests, and even coastal regions. The diverse geography and climate support a wide variety of ecosystems, including tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones.
2. **Endemic Species**: The Amazon is home to an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 endemic species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. These species are found only in the Amazon and nowhere else in the world.
3. **Age of the Forest**: The Amazon forest is one of the oldest on Earth, with some trees estimated to be over 3,000 years old. This has allowed for a long history of evolution, adaptation, and diversification of species.
4. **Long History of Human Activity**: Human activity in the Amazon dates back thousands of years. Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for centuries, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been living in the Amazon for over 20,000 years. This long history of human presence has allowed for the development of complex societies, including the indigenous communities that still live in the Amazon today.
5. **Evolutionary History**: The Amazon region has a unique evolutionary history, with many species having evolved from common ancestors. This has allowed for the development of diverse species that have co-evolved over time.
6. **Limited Habitat Fragmentation**: The Amazon region has relatively few large-scale habitat fragmentation events compared to other regions. This has allowed for a greater degree of connectivity between habitats, supporting the movement of species.
7. **High Biodiversity Threshold**: The Amazon region has a high biodiversity threshold, meaning that it can support a wide range of species without becoming overwhelmed. This has allowed for a diverse range of species to thrive in the region.
8. **Low Human Population Density**: The Amazon region has a relatively low human population density compared to other regions. This has allowed for a greater degree of ecological isolation between different habitats, supporting the diversity of species.
9. **Ecological Resilience**: The Amazon region has a high level of ecological resilience, meaning that it can recover from disturbances and changes to its environment. This has allowed for the diversity of species to persist over time.

These factors have combined to","I think you're talking about the Amazon rainforest, which is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

There is something about the amiebota that has me wanting to know more about it. It is very important to me that it be a game that people want to play. I will never know the answer to that question. A game about amigos, a character that was created for amizons, is an amicable game for a few people. That is not true. Amiibos are like the person who was brought to life by a movie.

What makes those long medical operations so long? How do surgeons make it through them?,"For a long time the most dangerous part of a surgery was the anesthesia. (This led to surgeries being done as QUICKLY as possible as to not kill the patient, cause permanent brain damage...ect) As the science of anesthesia got more advanced and magnitudes safer surgeons moved to a ""slow and steady"" approach to surgeries. Depending on age, weight, liver function, kidney function, and physical fitness a person can easily be under for 12+ hours with minimal side effects.  As to your second question often for surgeries that last very long have multiple surgeons present to offer advice/operate on what their specialty actually is.","Long medical operations can be challenging for surgeons and their teams. Several factors contribute to the duration of these operations. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **Complexity of the procedure**: Many surgeries involve complex procedures that require multiple steps, incisions, and manipulations. This complexity can lead to longer operations.
2. **Time-consuming procedures**: Some surgical procedures, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) or hernia repair, can be lengthy due to the need for precise and delicate dissections.
3. **Anesthesia and pain management**: Patients often require multiple rounds of anesthesia, which can add to the overall duration of the operation. Additionally, managing pain and ensuring patient comfort can be time-consuming.
4. **Post-operative care**: After the operation, patients may need to stay in the hospital for several days, which can increase the overall duration of the operation.
5. **Team coordination**: Surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals must work together to coordinate the operation, which can take time.
6. **Equipment and technology**: Modern surgical equipment and technology can be expensive and time-consuming to set up and maintain, which can contribute to the operation's duration.
7. **Patient's condition**: In some cases, patients may have underlying health conditions that require additional time and attention during the operation.

To make it through these long operations, surgeons and their teams employ various strategies:

1. **Preparation and planning**: Surgeons thoroughly prepare for the operation by reviewing the case, discussing with the team, and planning the procedure.
2. **Communication**: Clear communication among the team is crucial to coordinate the operation and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
3. **Multidisciplinary teamwork**: Surgeons work closely with other healthcare professionals to manage the patient's care and minimize downtime.
4. **Continuous learning**: Surgeons stay up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge and techniques to improve their skills and adapt to changing circumstances.
5. **Patient education**: Educating patients about their condition, treatment options, and potential risks can help them prepare for the operation and make informed decisions.
6. **Time management**: Surgeons and their teams must manage their time effectively to ensure that the operation runs smoothly and efficiently.
7. **Team bonding**: Building strong relationships among team members can help them work together more effectively and reduce stress during the operation.

By employing these strategies, surgeons and their teams can navigate the complexities of long medical operations and deliver high-quality care","They make it through it because they are doctors, not surgeons. They are the ones who do the actual surgery. The surgeons are the ones who supervise the procedure and make sure that it is done correctly.

They are the ones who are the ones who are most skilled in surgery. They are the ones who know what to do to fix the patient.<|eot_id|>","(i have a theory: the long surgery is just a matter of time, but the doctors at the hospital are doing it for a long time and they are not doing long surgeries for long periods of times, so it is a bit of a mystery why they don't get the surgery done for the time being.)i know, i know. I have to admit that i am not a fan of the idea that long-term long term longer surgical operations are somehow a good thing. That i'm not sure what i would be doing. I guess i could go on and on. But i can't think of any of this as a big deal. It is more of an idea. So i'll just go ahead and make a list of what is good and bad and what the difference is. First, there are three main reasons why long or short- term surgical operation is bad for your health: 1) it can be difficult to get right. 2) your body can get sick and you can never get back to the health it once was. 3) the pain is worse than you think. If you are going to have long, long surgical surgeries, you must first make sure that your body is not going through the same sort of pain that you had before. The problem is that while your pain tolerance is great, it can quickly go down when your skin is starting to take on some of its own weight. And once you get used to that, your whole body will start to burn up. Because your blood pressure is going down, blood sugar is low, and your metabolism is sluggish. In short, if your heart rate is high, the blood is getting too high. This is why it takes so much effort to treat all of these problems. Your liver will be very, very sluggish, while the kidneys will get a lot of blood. As a result, most of your muscles will not be able to contract. You will need to rest for about 20-30 minutes a day. Some people have trouble with this because they have too much fluid in them, which can cause a kind of ""coughing up"" effect on their bones. These problems can last for as long as they can take. Many people will have problems with a number of things, including: fatigue, headaches, depression, muscle spasms, fatigue and nausea. (for some people, these are the symptoms of heart disease, for others, they're the result of having a heart attack or stroke.) the body has to work hard to maintain proper health, especially when it comes to healing itself. After all, people with diabetes have been known to need help for over 30 years. Longer operations can also cause heart problems and even heart attacks. To help you avoid these complications, some surgeons have suggested that it's best to give yourself a prescription for antibiotics before you do any long long operations. A prescription can help keep your kidneys and heart functioning properly. But if you don. . . Well, wait a minute. What about the rest of it? The rest is up to you. Here are some things you should know:1. There is no cure for heart failure. Heart failure is an infection of our heart. We do not know exactly what causes heart cancer, or how many people get it. However, many of us have had it happen to us. Most people who get heart surgery have not had a chance to live a full life. For many, that means that they will never have the kind that can live out their full lives. Instead, when they do, their health will deteriorate. They will die of cancer or heart complications. Then, after a short period of recovery, a person's heart will fail and there will always be a problem with the heart itself, not with other parts of their body. Even if the problem was caused by a tumor, this can still be life-threatening. Also, even if a cancerous tumor doesn't show up, its symptoms can often be fatal. Remember, heartburn is the most common cause of death among people at high risk for cancer. People who suffer from heart conditions have better health than those who don, because heart burn is usually the cause. Sometimes the only way to prevent heart trouble is to go to a hospital. Another way is by getting a blood test. Once you have your test done, take the test and take it home. Don't just take a test, just give it to your doctor. An example of how to do that is given in this post .2. When you take your medication, make your own medicines. Yes, no matter how much you like to feel good, sometimes you will find that feeling of goodness and happiness can have harmful effects on your immune system. Just remember that if it makes you feel bad, then you need some help. On the other hand, good medicines are helpful, too. Check out this helpful guide . You can","Ive seen surgeons who are in the process of finishing the surgery but the end result is really, really fast. I'm not an expert on this but i'll explain. The surgeons are very skilled at their jobs and it takes a lot of training to master the skills that they do. They are trained to be able to do the specific job, not just the last one. This is why they're often in a position of absolute power. If you are going to end up in that position you need to know how to get the parts and the procedures done and how they will fit into the patient's body. So, they have to learn how it's done in an instant. You'll get a great idea of what they need done. There are many different ways to go about it. Sometimes they just want to see if the person they want is going well. Other times they look for a patient who is sick. It can be a matter of not being able help quickly enough. But in general they don't know all the things that you might want them to understand. And they can get by on their own. That's why surgeons do a really good job. Not everyone does well at a particular job so they end ups at the other jobs. People who do poorly in their job are generally just as good as they get paid for it because they did in other professions. Some people.

Why do enzymes denature when sitting out at room temperature but not inside our bodies?,"> Are they constantly denaturing and being synthesized or is there some other trick? Close - proteins are being constantly synthesized and degraded in the cell (obligatory [Wiki article](_URL_0_)). Insofar as to how enzymes survive in the cell, well, the typical estimates for the inside of a cell are high ionic strengths ( ~ 0.3 M salt) and significant macromolecular crowding (one estimate suggests 0.3 to 0.4 g of macromolecules per gram of total cell paste).  Enzyme preparations are frequently found in relatively weakly buffered/electrolytic solutions with minimal crowding agents (unless you're using something like a glycerol suspension).","Enzymes denature when exposed to room temperature, but they remain functional inside the body. Here's why:

1. **Protein Structure**: Enzymes are proteins, and their three-dimensional structure is crucial for their function. When proteins are exposed to heat, their structure can become disrupted, leading to denaturation.
2. **Disulfide Bonds**: Enzymes often have disulfide bonds between their cysteine residues, which are crucial for their activity. These bonds are typically formed when the protein is folded in its native state. When the protein is exposed to heat, the disulfide bonds can break, leading to denaturation.
3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Enzymes often have hydrogen bonds between their amino acids, which are essential for their function. These hydrogen bonds can be disrupted by heat, leading to denaturation.
4. **Polarity**: Enzymes are polar molecules, meaning they have a slight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other end. When exposed to heat, the protein can become polar, leading to a change in its conformation and denaturation.

In contrast, enzymes inside the body are often shielded from heat by various mechanisms, such as:

1. **Cytosol**: Enzymes are found in the cytosol of cells, which is a fluid environment that is not exposed to heat.
2. **Peroxisomes**: Peroxisomes are organelles that contain enzymes that can withstand heat.
3. **Heat-Shock Proteins**: Some enzymes have heat-shock proteins that help protect them from heat damage.
4. **Stable Conformation**: Many enzymes have a stable conformation that is resistant to heat damage.

When enzymes are exposed to room temperature, they can still maintain their native structure and function, even if they are not shielded from heat. However, when they are exposed to heat, they can denature, leading to a loss of function and potentially toxic effects.<|eot_id|>","Enzymes are proteins that are made up of many different amino acids. The amino acids are linked together by a special molecule called a peptide bond. The peptide bonds are very strong and can withstand a lot of heat. The reason enzymes denature is because the heat causes the peptide bonds to break. The amino acids are so small that they can fit into a tight space and the peptide bonds are so strong that they can withstand the heat. If the enzyme is exposed to room temperature, the temperature is not high enough to cause the peptide bonds to break. The amino acids are so small that they can fit into a tight space and the peptide bonds are so strong that they can withstand the temperature. If the enzyme is exposed to room temperature, the temperature is not high enough to cause the peptide bonds to break.  The reason enzymes don't denature in our bodies is because the temperature is high enough to cause the peptide bonds to break.<|eot_id|>","The enzyme that can degrade and eventually die can't survive outside the body without an enzyme in it. A lot of people think that is a little weird because it is impossible to kill the enzyme and the enzymes can be stored. In fact, it turns out that enzymes are in their natural state of decomposition in the stomach. It's a problem.1. There's no way to remove the acid from the digestive system. 2. The enzyme can only be killed by the ingestion of an acidic solution. So how do you get rid of the toxic enzymes? 3. If you do not have the right enzyme, the toxins are too large to be absorbed through the intestine. (a lot people have a hard time with their stomach acid.)4. Your body needs enzymes to fight off the acids. When you have enzymes in your digestive tract, you need to dig them out. They are everywhere. And they can do a lot more harm than good. These enzymes destroy the ""bad"" enzymes by killing the good ones. This is why the only way you can prevent the harmful enzymes from being absorbed is to get them off of your body. Just like the liver destroys the bad enzymes, so does the gut. Here's an example of a healthy, balanced diet. All you eat is food. You don't need any enzymes. A healthy diet will provide you with the nutrients you want to use. But when you lose your enzymes you will have to eat a diet that does not include any. Because the problem with enzymes is that they kill your immune system, which is the reason they are so hard to clean up. We need enzymes that kill all the negative enzymes and kill everything else.5. No one knows how much time you should spend digesting food, or how many times you must eat. 6. As you consume more foods, your metabolism will begin to change. After a while, food will become more acidic. Food will be acidic because the amino acids are not present in there. Instead, they will take up more of their energy. Now you are eating more food because you know that the proteins are going to go away. Since amino acid levels are high, more amino is going into the food and so more energy is being consumed. One of my favorite foods is rice, but i have never eaten it in a day. I can eat it at home or in my office. Once i started to digest rice for breakfast, i ate it a few times a week. That was a long time before i realized that it was not all that good, and that i had to work for more calories and eat more vegetables. My body was changing, too. ____________________________________________________________""i'm so glad you said you weren't eating any of this. To your face, that's all i'm going on about. Don't worry about it, man. Everything you've said about food is just a lie. Eat what you like and you'll have your own opinion on it."" - dr. D. A. G. St. John","~~we can't really explain why enzymes die, but i think they can.~~ this is a simplified explanation, though i hope it helps. The enzymes themselves are still there, they just take up more space. If you put a sugar molecule in your food, it won't take any space, so it will eventually be broken down by the body. So if the sugar molecules are denatured by a chemical reaction, the enzyme will continue to work, and eventually the food will be made of sugar. Once the sugars have been broken apart, there is no room for the proteins to build up in the cells, which will lead to the degradation of the amino acid residues in our dna. As for your question, that depends on the type of enzymes you have. For example, a protein denatures when it has a low affinity for something, or a enzyme that is very active at high temperature, when the protein is denated. These are called [binding sites](_url_0_). This means that when they are broken into smaller pieces, some of them can be absorbed by our cells. When you are in a cold environment, most of these little sites will die and your cells will become useless. In other words, you can keep your body from becoming useless for a while. It's possible to get a little bit of protein, protein in one of your dnas. Edit: formatting: this isn't my own dns. I'm not aware of a scientific explanation.

Enzymes are the same thing. Not the thing that break down proteins. They do not stay in cells and denaturate. Proteins denase proteins in proteins so they will denate and bind to other molecules. There are proteins that are inactive. Dinitrogenic. Protein ds are just like how proteins without the dase is active.

How do football commentators manage to know all the players' names at all times?,"Sports commentators do a lot of preparation before a game. A lot. They try to memorize all sorts of stuff about each team and players, as well as memorizing all the players, positions and numbers.  They don't just show up in the booth and wing it. They prepare. They have also been around the sport for a long time, are professionals, and are very good at what they do. While they are broadcasting, they often have computers and sheets printed out with all of this info as well to reference.","Football commentators typically have access to a vast database of player information, which they use to provide accurate and timely commentary. Here's a general overview of how they manage to know all the players' names at all times:

1. **Player databases and databases updates**: Football clubs and leagues maintain extensive databases of player information, including names, positions, countries of origin, and other relevant details.
2. **League and club databases**: These databases are updated regularly and contain detailed information about every player on a team.
3. **Media and broadcasting companies' databases**: Many media and broadcasting companies, such as BBC Sport, Sky Sports, and ESPN, have their own databases of player information.
4. **Player registration and paperwork**: When a player signs a contract or joins a club, the club or league will typically register the player and provide them with a player registration document. This document usually includes the player's name, date of birth, and other relevant details.
5. **Commentators' access to databases**: Commentators usually have access to these databases, either through their own subscription or through a secure online platform provided by the broadcaster.
6. **Pre-game and pre-match briefings**: Before each match, commentators will often receive information about the teams, players, and other relevant details from the league, clubs, or media outlets.
7. **Live updates and post-match analysis**: Commentators will also receive live updates and analysis from the match, which will often include the names of players who have made a substitution, been sent off, or made other significant changes.

While it's not possible to know all the players' names at all times, commentators usually have access to a limited amount of information at any given time. They may not have access to the exact same information as the clubs or leagues, but they will still be able to provide accurate and timely commentary.

In terms of specific databases, some examples include:

* The International Football Association Board (IFAB) maintains a comprehensive database of football statistics, including player information.
* The English Football Association (EFA) maintains a database of football players, which is used by various media outlets and broadcasters.
* The Football Writers Association (FWA) maintains a database of football players, which is used by various media outlets and broadcasters.

These databases are constantly updated, and commentators typically have access to the most up-to-date information.<|eot_id|>","They have access to the team rosters, and they have a lot of other information about the players that they can use. They can also get a lot of information from other sources. One way is that they can read the newspaper. The other way is that they can watch the games and look for the players' names on the scoreboard. In addition, they can also use the NFL's website, which has a list of all players in the league, along with their stats.<|eot_id|>","I guess they just keep doing that when the game is on, so they know who they are and where they stand. They know how much to talk about what is going on in the background, the games going, and how the fans are reacting. _______________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________ __________ _____ __________________this is the second time this year that i've been to the league. I am currently at the level of a very good pro. I'm also not an idiot. It is a wonderful day for all of us. And this is just the beginning. We are already close to reaching the top of the eastern conference and there is no way this team can beat any team in this league without the help of some amazing players. That being said, this game has been a great experience and i hope to continue to help out others in my league with my coaching and coaching skills.","Ive heard of the announcers, but they are always on the field. They have a team of announers. The other announcer is called a ""panther"" or a sideline announcer. This is the same guy that plays the ""boop"" for the nfl. All i have heard is that he has a special team called ""the booth"" that is used to broadcast the game. These booths are usually used for different things. For instance, if they play the patriots, they will have booth announcans on every play. As a side note, the booth is usually on a big field with a large amount of fans cheering, so it is much easier to have them on and off the sidelines. It also helps that the announcer has to keep his team's identity and identity in mind when he plays. He may not always be on, he might be in the pocket of a wide receiver, or he could be the only wideout. I know for a fact that some players are on their own in this scenario, i just know that it's not a common thing. Edit: i should mention that i am not an expert on football, and this may be incorrect.

Why can we get some diseases only once when others require vaccines every few years ?,It mainly comes down to the mutation rate of the pathogen. Some viruses like Varicella which cause chicken pox do not mutate at a fast enough rate to elude the immune system. Influenza on the other hand rapidly changes the subtype of surface antigens to evade the human immune system which requires new vaccinations to target the anticipated changes.,"There are several reasons why some diseases can only be contracted once, while others require vaccination every few years. Here are some key factors:

1. **Mortality rate**: Diseases with high mortality rates, such as smallpox, are more likely to be contracted only once. The mortality rate is the percentage of people who die from a disease. Diseases with low mortality rates, like the flu, are more likely to be spread and contracted multiple times.

2. **Incubation period**: The incubation period is the time between exposure to a disease and the onset of symptoms. Diseases with shorter incubation periods, like the flu, are more likely to be spread and contracted multiple times.

3. **Transmission dynamics**: Some diseases, like malaria, are transmitted through vectors (like mosquitoes), which can be controlled through vaccination and other preventive measures. In contrast, diseases like HIV/AIDS, which is spread through blood transfusions, can only be contracted once.

4. **Immunity**: Some people may be naturally immune to a disease, either due to past infection or genetic predisposition. This means they won't get the disease again, even if they're exposed.

5. **Vaccine efficacy**: Vaccines work best when they're given early in life, as the immune system is more effective in producing antibodies against a vaccine. This is why vaccines are typically administered in childhood, before the person has been exposed to the disease multiple times.

6. **Disease ecology**: Some diseases, like the plague, are highly pathogenic and can spread quickly through a population. In these cases, it may not be possible to vaccinate everyone, and the disease may only be contracted once.

On the other hand, diseases that require vaccination every few years are often:

- **Infectious diseases**: Diseases like the flu, pneumonia, and tuberculosis can only be contracted once, as they're transmitted through respiratory droplets.
- **Vector-borne diseases**: Diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus are spread through vectors, which can be controlled through vaccination and other preventive measures.
- **Viral diseases**: Diseases like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and Ebola can only be contracted once, as they're transmitted through blood, semen, or other bodily fluids.

It's essential to note that while some diseases can only be contracted once, there are still many ways to prevent and control outbreaks. Vaccines, personal protective equipment, and other preventive measures can help mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.<|eot_id|>","Vaccines are designed to be very effective, but they are not perfect. They are designed to be effective against a specific disease, and to only be effective against that disease. So if you get a disease, it's because you had a previous exposure to that disease. But if you don't have the disease, it's because you have no exposure to that disease. So you don't get it because you are not exposed to it, you get it because you were exposed to it in the past.<|eot_id|>","In fact, we know that vaccines are not used in every case. However, as the scientific literature demonstrates, there is a need to make sure that the current and future vaccines can be used to prevent all diseases. In addition, it is important to be aware of the fact that all vaccines require a specific type of vaccine (the 'vaccine-preventative' vaccine). The key here is to know the type and type (or number) of vaccines to use. The most common vaccines we have seen are those that are given to the elderly. Some vaccines for people with cancer are called 'pre-surgical' vaccines. Others, such as those given by the nhs, are 'retroviral' (vaxel-based) vaccines and some are non-retropical (proteins). Some are even offered as 'natural' medicines. If you are a doctor, you may have already seen the benefits of having a vaccine in your body. These are the most commonly used vaccines, and many of them are also very good for you. So, how can you get vaccinated ?we know from experience that there are different types of diseases, which are very different from each other. As such, some of these diseases may be very important for your health. It is only when you know how to get the best possible result from a given vaccine, that you can get a good vaccine. For example, if you have a very high risk of measles and you don't have the measles vaccine as part of your routine, then you won't get measles if your vaccine is given in the first place. There are other diseases which you should know about before you decide to give your first dose of a new vaccine to your child. But, when it comes to vaccines , it's important that your parents and doctor know what diseases are most important in their child and how they can best protect them. So, what are some general guidelines for getting vaccinated?the most basic guidelines are:1. Get vaccinated before any other medical condition. This is also known as a 'proper' vaccination. 2. Don't take any new medication. 3. Take a regular, healthy diet and exercise. 4. Keep a healthy weight. 5. Have a strong immune system. 6. Stay away from drugs. 7. Stop taking all your medications and supplements. 8. Do not drink alcohol or caffeine. 9. Be careful not to eat too much food. 10. Eat a balanced diet. 11. Avoid caffeine and other food additives. 12. Drink water in moderation. 13. Make sure you drink plenty of water. 14. Exercise regularly. 15. Work out regularly and dont eat any extra foods. 16. Try to avoid alcohol and tobacco. 17. Use a safe and healthy lifestyle. 18. Enjoy the outdoors and take care of yourself. 19. Always use a condom. 20. Know what to do if it causes any problems. 21. Never take drugs that could cause any harm. 22. Wear a protective protective clothing. 23. Not take medications that cause damage to yourself or others. 24. Treat your anxiety and depression with medication . 25. Continue to have regular exercise and enjoy your life. 26. Remember to wear appropriate protective gear. 27.

You need to develop a vaccine that will be effective at a certain disease, and then you have to put in new vaccines that are designed to work the other way. If you are getting a new vaccine for a disease that you can't get, it's going to cost you money. It can be expensive to make a few new ones, because people are already doing this. But you only have so many vaccines to get the disease. So you will need more, more. Now, if we all just started vaccinating, we would all get sick, but we're not. We have an idea what's in it, which is why we need vaccines. They are still expensive, they're just not working. Edit: i'm sorry, i don't know how to explain this correctly.

How did the USA become one nation?,"During the American Revolution and in its immediate aftermath, the former colonies were organized under the Articles of Confederation, which did indeed give most of the power to state governments rather than a central federal government. This caused a lot of problems, chief of which was that the federal government could not compel the state governments to give them money to pay the soldiers who had fought in the war. The problems with the Articles of Confederation prompted the drafting and ratification of the US Constitution, which created the United States of America as we know it today, with a federal government sharing power with state governments (although nowadays, the federal government definitely has the lion's share of the power).","The United States of America became a one nation through a series of events and processes that unfolded over several centuries. Here's a brief overview:

**Early Colonization and the Constitution (1600s-1700s)**

* The Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1620, establishing the first European settlement in North America.
* The British colonies in North America, established by the British Crown, were initially governed by a system of government that allowed for local self-governance.
* As the colonies grew in population and size, they began to develop their own systems of government, including the Massachusetts Bay Colony (1629) and the New York Colony (1626).

**The Articles of Confederation (1776-1781)**

* The American Revolution (1775-1783) led to the creation of the Articles of Confederation, a loose alliance of states that governed themselves without a central authority.
* The Articles of Confederation were designed to promote unity and cooperation among the states, but they proved ineffective in enforcing laws and resolving disputes.

**The Constitutional Convention (1781-1787)**

* In response to the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention was convened in Philadelphia to draft a new system of government.
* The Convention produced the United States Constitution, which was ratified by the states in 1787.
* The Constitution established a federal system of government, with three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial.

**The Bill of Rights (1791-1796)**

* The Bill of Rights, which consists of the first ten amendments to the Constitution, was ratified in 1791.
* The Bill of Rights protected individual rights and freedoms, including the right to free speech, assembly, and the press.

**The Federalist System (1787-1800)**

* The Federalist System, which was established by Alexander Hamilton, provided a framework for the federal government to function effectively.
* The System consisted of a strong central government, a system of checks and balances, and a network of state governments to ensure that the federal government was accountable to the people.

**The Bill of Rights and the Constitution's Three Branches (1791-1800)**

* The Bill of Rights and the Constitution's three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) provided a framework for the federal government to function effectively.
* The Constitution's three branches ensured that power was divided among the branches, preventing any one branch from becoming too powerful.

**The War of 181","The American Revolution was a civil war between the colonies and the British Empire. After the war, the colonies were granted independence, and the newly formed United States of America was formed. The U.S. Constitution was written in 1787, and ratified in 1788. The Constitution was the first attempt at creating a federal government, and it was designed to be a strong central government, but it was also designed to allow states to have a degree of autonomy. The Constitution also granted the power of taxation to the federal government, and it established the principle that the federal government would be responsible for the defense of the country. The Constitution also established the principle that the federal government would be responsible for the rule of law, and it established the principle that the federal government would be responsible for the protection of the rights of the citizens of the country. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, and it became the law of the land.<|eot_id|>","It is not because of a simple political line or political party, but because the current government is a country that is run by the people. It is also because it is governed by a government that has the means to do what the country needs, such as to implement the constitution and to have the law in place. This is the government of the nation that the constitution was written for. The current state of affairs is that it has no power to make laws. Therefore, the state is under the control of its own people, and it does not have any control over the laws of other nations. The nation is divided into three states, one for each of which it can decide the direction of development. In other words, if a nation's government has a decision to take, it would have to go to the other three nations for it to be approved. However, for the u. S., there is no legal right to change the course of history. And if the president of each nation does change, that's because he or she is elected by all of them, not just the one who is actually elected. If the united states has adopted a policy of nationalization, then the next president of that nation would be the last one to sign the treaty. That's a political decision, which is why the president would not be elected in the future. He would only be on the ballot for a period of time. When he takes office, he will decide who will be president. At that point, all other members of congress will vote for him. There are many other political decisions that can go on for years. But, there's nothing like the experience of having a presidential election that lasts for so long. We would never have known that, even in a post-citizens united world. So, a president who has to decide what he wants to pursue, who he trusts, what his priorities are, how he plans to move forward, is essentially a dictator. A dictator that does what it wants. Then, when the time comes, they can either say, ""well, we're going to build a wall along our southern border, or we can start a military buildup there."" it's the same with the situation of an industrial complex. Once we start building up our military, you can't build it again, because you cannot build an infrastructure. Now, building a new infrastructure is like building an airplane. You cannot fly it. Your aircraft can fly and you have no control, no way to control it, so you must build something. Our government, on its part, doesn't have control. Its sole decision is whether it will take action. Sometimes we don't want to say that we want it built. Some of us do. They're just not going anywhere. Others, i guess, don. Either way, people are going nowhere. One of our goals is to create a democratic and free society. I think that that could be achieved by creating a constitutional republic, where the american people have a voice, by exercising their will, exercising the power of their government. On the contrary, our country is broken. People are being murdered. Millions of people die in america every year. Not just because we have not had a representative government; people in this country are dying because their lives have been taken from them. These are people who have had no choice but to live. For the first time in history, democracy can be realized without any political will. No one has ever won a race. Nobody has won the lottery. Everyone is getting a fair share of benefits. None of it really matters. All of this is because democracy is based on free enterprise, fair trade, free trade in goods, freedom of religion, equal rights for all. Those are all things that are inalienable. Nothing of substance can ever change that. Democracy is an idea, an ideal, based upon the principles that i believe are the basic foundation of any democracy. From that standpoint, this whole idea of democracy has been hijacked by people that have never been able to think for themselves. How do you build up a democracy when it doesn--ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard of ""democracy"" or ""free enterprise""? It means that there are a number of things in your country, some of these things have already been done, others haven't been. What are some? I want you to look at the list of countries in which you are proud to stand. Let me explain what i mean. As a general rule, every country has its share. Obviously, in other countries, too, your share is very small. Even in our own countries there will sometimes be a few members. Often, as in many places, at least one member is from your own country. Thus, these countries are not the only ones with a share in things like free markets, social welfare, education, etc. To be honest, most of those countries have only a small amount of","Ianasius the great was a member of the empire, but was also a slave owner. He owned slaves in the united states, and used them to buy slaves. So the american government became a nation. It was not until after he was captured by the allies in wwii that he became the ruler of russia, which was another nation, as well. That is why the name of his empire is russian, not america. (i think the title of ""the roman empire"" is a bit of a misnomer, though.) the word ""nation"" comes from the latin word for ""people"" (mnsus). ""nations"" was the first name given to the various nations that existed at the time of its formation. The english empire was an independent nation until the 17th century, when it became part of england. By that time, the term ""united states"" meant all the nations in europe.

How does the Space Station not run out of oxygen?,"Is actually not that hard to make oxygen. They have a readily available supply of water in the form of what they bring from Earth, plus what they can save from their waste material (and yes that includes feces) and what the ISS can save from the humidity in the air.  A bit of this water is then processed through electrolysis and separated into Hydrogen and Oxygen. I... Don't really know what they do with the Hydrogen after that, though, but the Oxygen is circulated through the ISS.","The Space Station's oxygen supply is managed by a combination of several factors to ensure a steady supply of breathable air. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Oxygen Generation**: The space station is equipped with oxygen generators, which use a combination of oxygen-rich gases (like oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) and a catalyst to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. These gases are then used to generate oxygen.
2. **Oxygen Storage**: The oxygen generated by the generators is stored in tanks or containers, which are then transported to the space station.
3. **Oxygen Distribution**: The oxygen is distributed to the space station's living quarters, life support systems, and other areas through a network of pipes and tubes. The oxygen is released into the air through valves and nozzles.
4. **Oxygen Recycling**: The space station has a closed-loop life support system, where the air is recycled and reused. The oxygen-rich air is vented out into space, while the nitrogen and other gases are collected and stored for later use.
5. **Oxygen Concentrators**: Some space stations have oxygen concentrators, which use a process called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove carbon dioxide and other gases from the air. This process recovers the oxygen and releases the other gases.
6. **Regular Maintenance**: The space station's life support systems are regularly maintained to ensure they are functioning properly. This includes checks on the oxygen generators, oxygen storage tanks, and recycling systems.

By combining these factors, the Space Station can maintain a steady supply of breathable oxygen, even in the absence of Earth's atmospheric pressure.<|eot_id|>","The ISS is designed to run on a continuous supply of oxygen and fuel.  The oxygen is stored in liquid form, and is pumped from the fuel tank into the ISS. The fuel is stored in solid form, and is pumped from the fuel tank into the ISS. The oxygen is consumed by the ISS's power systems, and the fuel is consumed by the ISS's propulsion systems.  The ISS has two tanks that are used to store oxygen and fuel. The oxygen tank is located in the forward section of the ISS, and the fuel tank is located in the aft section of the ISS. The two tanks are separated by a small hatch that allows the crew to access the tank. The hatch is used to replace the oxygen and fuel tanks with new ones every 20 days.  The ISS uses a combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to power its propulsion systems. Liquid oxygen is used for the ISS's propulsion systems, and liquid hydrogen is used for the ISS's life support systems. The ISS also uses a combination of solid fuel and liquid fuel for its propulsion systems.<|eot_id|>","Ive seen a lot of people who say that it does not get oxygen, but i would say it is not that big of a deal. I think it would be nice to know if the astronauts are able to get some oxygen for use on the shuttle or something. John kelly: that's a good question. It would definitely help with the problem of getting the oxygen in. Because if we were to go back to the original design, it was only in the early 1960s that we could get it from the apollo 13, which was a very small spacecraft. We had to have a space capsule. So, we had two or three people on it, and it wasn't really a large spacecraft that you could actually do that on. But the other thing that was really important was that the crew could do the whole thing, just by means of the back-up equipment, the parachute. That was the basic thing for the shuttle. And that meant that if you were going to do a whole spaceflight, you needed to be able, as we say, to maintain the spacecraft and to make sure that every time you put it in orbit, there was enough oxygen there to keep the mission going. Which is very important for this project. The shuttle was going for about 40 years. There were a couple of times that i thought that that's all that mattered. In fact, i don't think we ever really thought about it. You know, back in 1962, when we first started, a shuttle mission was actually a bit of an experiment. This was kind of like a flight of fancy, sort of, where you had a bunch of things going on, like the instruments and the engines, etc., and you did it by the side of your spaceship. Then you started to really see that a little bit more. When you got to that point, in fact. Now we're really working on getting a full crew, so that will probably take a few years or a year or two.","~~in space, the oxygen is not very good at keeping things moving.~~ it doesn't take very long for the iss to burn up. It's basically an oxygen tank filled with air. The station is pressurized to near the atmospheric pressure. When the pressure gets low enough, it can no longer hold enough oxygen to keep things in orbit. [here's a picture of it.](_url_0_) the astronauts don't need to worry about it, they just need oxygen. Edit: typo. I'm not sure i meant the crew compartment. They don’t have to breathe. If they were, that would be the point. But then again, i dont know what that looks like. Maybe someone else can come along and correct me. Thank you. Also, you might be interested in [this](_url._1_). It‘s a really cool gif of the shuttle. You can see the air tank at the bottom of this gif. *edit2:** thanks to /u/kodaknin for pointing out that i“m wrong. This is a gif, not a video. See it here: _url__0_. Edit 3: i also have a different question. How did the temperature of a water bottle affect the water in the tank? I know that water is really hot, but how hot is the liquid water? What is it that? That” i can‡t it cold? And that is that temperature? The cold water that was the boiling? Oh, what temperature in that hot? It is boiling hot and is hot. That cold is just hot water boiling cold, and cold. Does it was cold and water and hot too hot in space? Is there? Hot but the same temperature and boiling and the other things? Edit 4: [edit 4. Sorry i just a question for that boiling, too cold too, so the answer. Ive heard about that. Too. A little water vapor pressure? How cold was hot it feels cold but not cold to me? So hot to what? My question, then i guess it should be cold or hot enough? Can i have been cold enough. Hot or cold just cold in a way too? Too much? No, hot/hot. In water. Answer? This was a cool little too big to be hot (or cold because of pressure) and temperature. There's too little? There is too far? A hot answer to that doesn„t mean cold/cold. And too low? Just too small? Then the way it must be boiling. Or boiling/boiling? Cold! It needs to heat. All things. So it might not be too cool? Also cold (the pressure and pressure is cold for something to get hot!

"Before Revealing Himself as ""Yahweh"" to Moses, What was the Hebrew God Called?",You may want to try asking this in /r/AcademicBiblical as well.,"Before revealing himself as ""Yahweh"" to Moses, the Hebrew God was called ""El Shaddai"" (also known as ""Elohei Israel"" in Hebrew). ""El Shaddai"" is a name that means ""God Almighty"" or ""God of the Fertile Land"" in Hebrew.

In the Hebrew Bible, the name ""El Shaddai"" is used to refer to the God who created and sustained the world, including the land of Israel. It is often associated with the concept of omnipotence and omniscience.

The name ""El Shaddai"" is also the name of the firstborn son of Jacob, who is later given the name ""Israel"" by his brother Esau (Genesis 32:18). This name change is significant, as it implies that the Israelites are now a distinct and separate nation from the rest of humanity.<|eot_id|>","You may be interested in the [FAQ section on the Israelites and their gods](_URL_0_) in the FAQ wiki, which includes a section on the ""names"" of the Israelites' gods.

The ""belly of death"" (deut. 13:27) is the body of an animal. In the case of animals the god of life is god, and in this case the animal is ""god."" the hebrew word for ""god"" for a dead animal (moses) literally means ""beast,"" and is used to refer to a living creature. Moses and the rest of his descendants, who died in captivity, were called the animals of god. They were described as having ""a body"" and were ""worshippers."" they are described by the jews as the descendants of adam and eve. As with the other animals mentioned above, god is described in terms of ""mighty animals."" and so god's body is referred to as a god-god, a god that is omnipotent. He is also described like a body, or like the head of any animal, but is actually a creature that exists only in his body. God has many names. These are the names that are used by jewish people as regards god:. . . The name of this god was, in hebrew, called ekkah (or ekah), and it is written in both hebrew and aramaic as elehi (ezra). It is commonly believed that this word means the lord's name, i. E., the almighty. It was also used in greek as ikah, ""to be."" it has also been used as in english as kahot, meaning ""lord."" there is a special form of eko, literally meaning god (isaiah), which can be read as eko. One may also use the word eke, to mean ""one who is like god."" eke was mentioned in deut 13 as being the hebrew name for the creature of darkness. Therefore, this name was used with great care and with a very large number of meanings. This name is, of course, very ancient in its origins, as is mentioned by ezekiel. And it may be said that the greek ekel, 'god,' is an ancient name. There are several names in aramaeans as well, eka, kab, kek, hkek and eki, that can refer only to god or to his name or the name of his kingdom. Some of these names are in fact from ancient aramas. All the others are found in many other languages, including the arabic and latin. Many of them are from the ancient near east. Most of those who were named ekes, are of araman descent. Their names include the following: ἀράγος ὅτιν ῆηγίον τῷ ᾑμακα ᴦσθέρου ḥδξεν. Ấὸς τὴν διαμήζεσα καὶ εἰρατειᾶς οᴅνομον τοὦ ξύσφας. ᪁νκεόμει ᤁγεμχοι. Λεολογαρικγοτο ღβών στὰ θεται ταοὐτậνωαα.

I'm not sure if this is what you mean by ""god's son"", but the name of the god is known as the ""son of god"", and is not actually written in the bible. It was known to have been the son ""jesu"", which is why joseph is written as james. The closest thing we have to a hemlock-like god like that is the greek god of war. He is called ""shab"" (hebrew for ""warrior"") because he fought for the jews against the persians. We don't really know what he looked like, but we do know that there are many greeks who believed in him. That being said, we know he wasn't born in judea, nor did he go to jupiter.

Why does cold weather smell different than warm weather?,"The chemicals which we smell have different tendencies to vaporize at different temperatures. Changing the temperature changes the mix of chemicals in the air, and by extension the smells you perceive.","Cold weather and warm weather have distinct scents due to the differences in the molecules that make up the air we breathe. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** The air we breathe contains tiny molecules of various chemicals, including VOCs. These molecules are responsible for the characteristic smells of different seasons.
2. **Cold Weather:** When it's cold outside, the air is filled with tiny particles of gases like methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. These gases are produced by the Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere.
3. **Warm Weather:** When it's warm outside, the air is filled with tiny particles of gases like ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and methane. These gases are produced by the oceans, vegetation, and wildfires.
4. **Chemical Reactions:** The VOCs in cold weather react with the air to produce specific smells. For example:
	* Methane (CH4) reacts with water vapor to produce a pungent, earthy smell.
	* Ammonia (NH3) reacts with other VOCs to produce a musty, unpleasant smell.
5. **Scents:** The specific combinations of VOCs in cold weather produce distinct scents, such as:
	* A fresh, earthy smell from methane
	* A musty, unpleasant smell from ammonia
	* A pungent, fishy smell from ozone
	* A sweet, floral smell from VOCs like terpenes

These scents are not only a result of the chemical reactions but also influenced by the temperature, humidity, and air pressure of the atmosphere. The combination of these factors creates the unique scents we associate with different seasons.

Keep in mind that the specific scents can vary depending on the location, climate, and other environmental factors. However, in general, cold weather tends to have earthy, musty, or pungent scents, while warm weather tends to have fresh, floral, or sweet scents.<|eot_id|>","The answer is simple: cold weather smells different than warm weather because the air is colder and there's less moisture in it. In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more. In cold weather, the air is much drier, which is why it smells so much more.  In the case of the nose, cold air is more dense than warm air, so it's more likely that the cold air is carrying more particles (like dust, pollen, etc.) into the nostrils. This is why cold weather smells so much more. In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more.  It's also possible that cold weather smells different because the air is so dry that it's not able to hold much moisture. This would be why it smells so much more.<|eot_id|>","The same thing that causes a cold. ______________________________________________________________________________a cold is a very cold place. The cold air is very strong and cold, cold and warm, warm and cool. It is always cold (or warm) and it is not cold in the least. For example, if you are in a place where the temperature is low, and the air has no air currents and you have no wind, it will be cold for the entire day. So cold conditions are not just cold when the wind is strong, but they are cold even when it's cold! ____________________________________________________________how to get a colder, warmer aira colder air will not only be more pleasant for you, you will also be able to see the coldness of the sky. In fact, the weather is so cold that it makes it impossible to take the time to look at it. Also, when you look to the clouds, that's when there is no cold sky, no clouds and no sun. You see, there are only three possible things you can see: the warm air, air that is warm (it is in air), the cool air (the cold) or the hot air. This is the reason that you need a hot, colder and more humid air to enjoy the beautiful and beautiful colors of your sky!cold, hot and humid weather can be very difficult to do because you know that there's always more air in your air than there actually is!

Check out my blog: http://cold-weather. Blogspot. Com/","~~cold air can be quite different from warm air, and cold air is more dense than hot air.~~ cold and warm are caused by the temperature difference between air that is less dense and air with more density. Cold vs warm can also be caused from the fact that the air around you is colder than the surrounding air which is warmer than your body temperature. So, if you are in a hot or cold room, you can smell the coldness of the room. If it's cold, then you smell it, but if the outside air has a lower density than it has air from outside, it will smell more strongly. The colder the ambient air temperature, the more you will be able to smell a smell, even though it is in the same volume. In short, because there is a difference in density of air compared to air at different temperatures, your nose and throat will pick up more of a scent, which will then be perceived more by your brain.

Do marshmallows get bigger or smaller in space?,"I actually just watched this demo less than a week ago. In the vacuum of space, they will get bigger because the pressure on the outside of the marshmallow drops, thus the solid part of the marshmallow gets pushed out by the gas in the marshmallow. However, these little pockets of air in the marshmallow will burst and the air will escape, so they will actually shrink a bit after they initially grow. You can watch the same thing I saw on [youtube](_URL_0_). When I saw the demo, they returned almost to the same size while still under vacuum, but don't take that as a definitive measurement on the net size increase. So, in summary, it grows, and then shrinks, so you're both kind of right. Pretty neat!","In space, marshmallows would not get bigger or smaller. This is because the laws of physics that apply on Earth do not apply in space. Specifically, there is no atmosphere to pull marshmallows down or to cause them to expand or contract.

In microgravity environments, objects like marshmallows float or remain suspended in mid-air, without any tendency to grow or shrink. This is due to the absence of gravity, which would normally cause objects to fall towards the ground.

So, in space, marshmallows would remain the same size as they are on Earth.<|eot_id|>","They will expand in the same way that a balloon does. If you had a balloon and you put a marshmallow inside it, and then you inflated the balloon, the marshmallow would expand, and the balloon would expand. The marshmallow would get bigger, and the balloon would get bigger. If you put a marshmallow inside a balloon, and then you inflated the balloon, the marshmallow would get smaller. The balloon would get smaller. If you put a marshmallow inside a balloon, and then you inflated the balloon, the marshmallow would get bigger. The balloon would get bigger. If you put a marshmallow inside a balloon, and then you inflated the balloon, the marshmallow would get smaller. The balloon would get smaller. So the answer is that they get bigger or smaller, depending on what is inside the balloon.<|eot_id|>","The bigger the marshmallow, the bigger it gets. Answer: marsh mallows don't get larger. Question: why is the name marshman going to be so popular in the future? Answer: to protect the original marshmen who were the first marsh men. (and to help with the development of the ""marshmallow man"" concept)the marshmans are the only marsh marsh man in existence. The marsh mans who are to follow the story of ""marshman"" are:- the king, king's father, marshman - the marsh, mockingjay (who is also the king's brother, in order to ensure the survival of his people) - marsh man, and marshmenmocking jocks are all the same. They are marsh guys who love to play with marsh bars and marsh treats. Mocking jocks are not marshy. They are mully. In fact, they are so marshly that they can only be called marsh. What is a marsh?a marsh is an animal that is attached to a tree or shrub, or is hung from a branch, that can be easily removed or taken off. It is called a ""marsh."" a marsh has two main types of muzzles: the head and the body. There are two types that are known to marsh: a head maul and a body mauve muffle. Both of these mocks can hold up to 40 or 50 marsh balls. A mule mike is considered a mooch. However, there are many different types, so you should ask the person who owns one of those types to check the other. If you have a good idea of what a particular mocking mook is, you can tell them. Just make sure you are checking the maunsel. When a person is mocked, he or she is ""stuck."" he or her is not a real marsh, but is just a little mooted out, a part of a large marsh that has been mown. These moggings are called ""snowballs."" when a snowball is left on a surface, it will fall off the ground, which causes it to fall into a pile. This is why the term marshball has a special meaning, as it means ""the snowfall."" this type of snowballs are made up of several marsh pieces. Each marsh piece is made of different colors and shapes. When you find a piece that looks like a whole marsh ball, don`t leave it on your desk. Also, make a note of which marsh you found. Make sure to keep your marsh blanket and any other items that you may find on the floor. You can also find your own marsh cookie jars, ice packs, marsh cookies, mugs, etc. And even marsh pies. That is what you will find in a moochoo. For more information about mummies, see mummies in space . How do i know if i have been a marshmallow? There is no one right answer for this question. Some people say that their mama and baby will never know what is going on in their world until they get a chance to know their parents. Others say they will know the answers to this very important question if they have seen a picture of their dad or mom in front of them in real life. We have learned that the answer is simple. Ask your parents to tell you what the world is like in your day. Don`t let them tell the difference between a normal day and an actual day, because the day is different. All you need is to ask them what it is that makes you happy. Most people will tell a story about their day like this: ""i was born in september of 1969. My mom had a birthday party in her room and she had no idea that my dad was a big part. So she sent me to see my mom. I told her i was going for a walk with my dad. She said, ""you will be there when you get there. Do you remember what your dad said about you?"" i remember saying, 'no, no, i don�t remember it. No, my mom just wanted to talk to me.'""i have never been in any of my life when my father was on television. He had to do a series of interviews to make it seem like he was talking about my mother. Then he went to the hospital and said his dad had died and that he didn�t want to hear about it because he would be out of town. But he never said anything about how he wanted my parents and i to get back to school. After that, his mother told him that she knew how much of her husband was dead and had made a decision to let him go. And then he told my mum that this was his decision. His mother then told me that her son had been","~~i am not sure about the size of the marshmallow, but they do get smaller.~~ [here's an article about it.](_url_0_) edit: i forgot to mention that the paper you linked to is [the marsh marsh-marshmallow experiment](_url_. It's not really a paper, though, it was an experiment that was done in the 1970s and the results are not well understood. It is, however, likely that marsh meringue is smaller than regular marymeringues. I don't know if that's true or not, since the article mentions that it may be that there are two types of marsh mold. Marsh and marshs, which are related, are both made from the same type of mold, and are in close proximity to each other. The latter is a type that grows faster and is more prevalent in marsh, while the former is rare. So the authors of that paper probably made the mistake of thinking that a marsh would grow larger than a regular marsh. Edit 2: found [this paper]( _url1_). Basically, marsh can grow to be as big as it likes, or bigger than it says. But marsh is not the exact same size. [but it looks like a lot of different marsh produce, so it has a smaller growth.]( _veriously). So that doesn't mean that if you get a normal marsh was the original marsh were to grow bigger, the author of this paper was wrong, he was mistaken. Sorry i'm sorry. That is the biggest marsh williams marsh has been wrong. There is marsh in fact that most marsh does not have marsh that same marsh as marsh made marsh to make the actual marsh from marsh for marsh (not just one marsh like marsh but a ""normal marsh). Edit 3: marsh grown from (and not marsh? Not even in reality marsh) marsh 2 marsh or more marsh because the entire marsh i know that ""m marsh doesn’s size is just marsh when it grows to large, not one type. And that” i have just made it from two different types. Source: _1 and i hope it‘s not from one. A bit more and so, i„m not. _2. This is probably not that one is bigger. M marsh too small, just like the others. Is from another source. Also, this marsh might be the result of two marsh types and it does grow from different parts of a different mold and not a whole marsh shape. Or something else marshy. (or some other marsh which grew from both. Some molds grow more, like regular. ) edit 1: and there may have been a source for both marshme, too. As the journal article said.

Why do different foods of the same mass have different amounts of calories?,"Your body isn't converting all the mass of a burger into energy lol. Only some of the energy bound up in food is utilized by your body, and **none** of it comes from converting mass into energy. Your body takes chemical potential energy from bonds between atoms in your food and (after generally storing that energy in different chemical bonds) utilizes it to drive all the processes that keep you alive. Much of the actual mass of the food is used as raw material to make structures your body needs like new cells etc. Some of that material is used wholesale because your body can't produce it on its own (like vitamins). Any mass your body can't use generally leaves the body with other waste. Some food has more, and more energetic, bonds that your body is capable of converting into energy than others.","Different foods of the same mass (mass) have different amounts of calories due to variations in their composition. Here's why:

1. **Protein content**: Foods with different protein contents have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of lean chicken breast (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 180-200 calories, while a serving of lean beef (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 250-300 calories.
2. **Carbohydrate content**: Carbohydrates are a significant source of calories in many foods. Different types of carbohydrates, such as whole grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes, have varying amounts of calories. For instance, a serving of whole grain rice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of starchy vegetable (such as broccoli) contains approximately 50-60 calories.
3. **Fat content**: Fats are another important source of calories in many foods. Different types of fats, such as saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of avocado (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 300-400 calories, while a serving of olive oil (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 120-180 calories.
4. **Vitamin and mineral content**: Foods with different nutrient profiles have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of vitamin D-fortified milk (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of vitamin D-fortified cereal (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 50-60 calories.
5. **Water content**: Foods with varying water contents have different amounts of calories. For example, a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories, while a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories.

To calculate the calorie content of a specific food, you need to know its composition, which includes its protein, carbohydrate, fat, and water content. By using a reliable online calculator or consulting a nutrition guide, you can determine the approximate calorie content of a specific food.

Keep in mind that these values are approximate and may vary depending on the specific food item, serving size, and preparation method.<|eot_id|>","Calories are a measure of energy.  Calories are measured by the amount of energy that a substance can provide when it is burned.  The amount of energy that a substance can provide is measured by the amount of heat that it releases when it is burned.  Different foods have different amounts of energy.  The reason that the same amount of food can have different amounts of calories is because of the different amounts of energy that different substances can provide when burned.  For example, a loaf of bread has a lot more energy than a piece of fruit, but the same amount of energy.

The body needs to know if it has enough energy to function properly. The amount it needs is determined by the amount that is consumed in a given day. Therefore, if you have a high energy intake, you will need to consume a lot more calories to get to that energy. Answer: the calories in the diet are the number of foods that are used to make the meal. A low amount will burn more energy than a great amount. So, in order to have the optimal amount, the energy needs must be very high. If you are on a low calorie diet, your body must use as much energy as possible to fuel the metabolism. It is very important to choose the correct amount for your food. For example, one of my favorite foods is bacon. I used it as a breakfast for a long time and have been eating it ever since. But, it seems that the bacon that i am eating has a very low energy content. This is because i have not had bacon for over 5 years. You can read more about my experience at http://www. Fatty-lifestyle. Com/blog/how-to-eat-your-healthy-foods/ . Question: can i eat a different type of food at the end of a meal? Answer: yes. There is no difference in calories, carbs, protein, and fat content between different types of meals. As long as you eat the proper amount each day, there is a good chance that you won't get any extra calories. Also, eating a higher amount does not make you fat. What is the difference between a lower amount and a larger amount? The difference is more important if there are two or more people. When you add in that one person, then the caloric difference from the other person will be larger. In fact, that's why you should use a smaller amount or a whole food like rice or wheat.","Ive never heard of this. But it's not just that they are different. In fact, most of what is consumed in food is energy. The energy is in the form of proteins and fats. That's why fats are very energy dense and so are the most energy efficient. This is why we eat a lot of protein. It provides a high protein content, and has a low fat content. There's more energy in a small amount of food, but the calories are spread out over a larger amount. And that is the big part. Now, if you want to look at what calories do, you'll have to go to the nutrition information site. _url_0_ this info is a good place to start. They do a great job of explaining it. Also, they make a big deal out of it, as they have a very large market for it so they can make money off of people who are willing to pay more for the product. So, it doesn't matter if the food has more calories than you. I don't know the numbers, so i can't give you the number. Just like you can buy a ton of fruit and vegetables and eat them for free. You should have no problem with buying a few calories for a meal. Edit: i am not an expert, just a chef. Sorry. Thanks! I'm just my name is [kevin r. Mcculloch](_url_.

In mathematics, a circle is defined as the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

The Pythagorean theorem can be represented as:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

In the case of a circle, we can consider the following points:

* The center of the circle (O)
* Any point on the circumference (A, B, C, etc.)
* Any point on the diameter (D, E, F, etc.)

To calculate the distance between any two points, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For example, the distance between points A and B is:

√(a^2 + b^2)

This distance is the same for any point on the circumference, because the circle is symmetric about its center.

Now, here's the interesting part: when we take the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances, we get the radius of the circle. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.

The reason a circle has only one dimension is that the distance between any two points on its circumference is always the same, regardless of the point's location. This means that the radius is always the same, and there is only one possible value for the radius.

In other words, a circle is a two-dimensional shape, but it only has one dimension because the distances between its points are always the same, and there is only one possible value for that distance.

So, to summarize, a circle is a mathematical concept that can be described in multiple dimensions, but its only dimension is the one that represents the distance between its points.<|eot_id|>","The number of dimensions of a space is determined by the number of independent coordinates we can define for a point in that space.

It has always been a popular view that the dimensions of a number are defined in terms of the number of dimensions in a set. However, in the past few decades, the standard definition of dimensionalism has been changed, and it has become increasingly difficult to find a precise way of defining dimension. Now, i think it is important to understand that in order to get to a better definition, one needs to take into account the fact that there are many dimensions, which makes it difficult for the same person to say which dimension to use. The problem is that a person who is using an external measurement is often the only one who can use it. This is why some people find it hard to define a dimension without being able to figure out which dimensions are actually used. This problem can be solved by using a simple mathematical model, namely a single number, called a square. A square is an object with an x and y coordinates. Because of this, it can represent any number in any dimension, including the one that is not a cube. But to do so, we have to include the square in our definition. For example, suppose that we want to make a triangle, but we don't know how to construct it, so we can't. So we use a mathematical formula to calculate the total number that would be needed to satisfy the equation. We then use the formula that can then be used to compute the x-y coordinates of each dimension in that triangle. Now, let's see how this works. Suppose we had a problem, that you need to solve for a specific dimension and then add it to the list. That is, say you have two triangles with different dimensions. One would have a different dimension than the other, because they are not the right size. To solve that problem we need a combination of both. In the example above, if we add the two triangle dimensions to our list, then we will get the correct number. If we do not do this in this particular case, our solution would look like this:x = 1y = 2here, x = 3, y = 4, etc. There are two possible solutions for this problem. Here is the first problem: we are going to divide by 2, add to it the dimension x, multiply it by a factor of 2. You may think that this is really a very difficult problem to deal with, since there would need be a lot of work to perform the calculation. I suppose you may be thinking that i am not so naive as to think this solution is correct. Yes, this may indeed be the case. Let me explain. First, you might think of it as solving for one or more dimensions by adding one to another. Second, a solution for each of these dimensions is going back to what the original solution was for. And third, there might be another problem that has a similar problem as the last. Now this does not mean that each solution needs a new dimension for all the numbers in it: it does mean there will be more than one. Indeed, for every number which has the appropriate dimension (a number with a certain dimension), there has to be an additional one which is greater than that. These are the generalizations of problem solving. As i said above for solving, each new solution will have different difficulties. When i say that every solution has problems, what i mean is: all solutions have problems. All solutions are solved. Each solution does have its own problems; and each problem has its problems when it comes to solving it itself. Why are we doing this? The answer is because there have been many problems that have never been solved before. Thus, some solutions do require a special problem which we now call a ""quantum problem"". In other words, they require the new problem because it solves for many more problems than it would otherwise have solved for it in its original state. Then, when we solve the problem for any of those solutions, all of them are also solved in their original states. After all, every new number is still the sum of all those numbers, even though we already have one new one in each state of our program. With this new fact, problems are always solved, regardless of whether the previous solution had been successful or not. Therefore, any problem may also be called ""normal"", or even ""supernormal"". Since it's always possible to have an infinite number and yet not have any problems at all in some way, such as being right or wrong, why not simply have the whole program solve all its possible problems and solve it all for you? Why not just have it solve everything for us?i would like to present a few examples of how the solution of every problem in my program is always the result of some special ""problem"" in itself, or a result from a particular experiment. Well, not exactly. Some problems have solutions which are","~~is it possible to have a finite number of dimensions?~~ yes, but the question is tricky. The answer is that we can't know what dimensions they are, or what their ""size"" is. We only know that the circumference of a sphere is the same as its diameter. But if we are able to say that a cube is a single-dimensional object, then we know the diameter of the circle. This is because we have already made an assumption that it is not a 3d object. So, we cannot know if it has a number smaller than 3. A 2d cube has infinite diameter, and a 4d square has finite diameter (for example). But we don't have any way of knowing whether the cube or cube can be described in the sense that they have infinite surface area. ______________________________ for a more general answer, the [wikipedia article](_url_0_) has some good information about it.

Why does my voice get deeper when I have a cold?,"The infection from having the cold causes both swelling of the vocal chords, and a coating of mucus. This makes them heavier and thus they move slower than normal, resulting in lower tones.","When you have a cold, your body's response to the infection is to increase the production of mucus and other fluids in your nasal passages and throat. This is a natural defense mechanism to trap the invading virus and help it leave your body.

As a result of this increased production, your vocal cords may become more relaxed and open, leading to a deeper or more raspy voice. This is because the increased mucus and fluid production can cause your vocal cords to vibrate more, producing a deeper or more resonant sound.

Additionally, when you have a cold, your body's immune system is also working harder to fight off the infection. This can cause your vocal cords to become more sensitive and less able to vibrate as efficiently, resulting in a deeper or more raspy voice.

It's also worth noting that some people may experience a phenomenon called ""vocal cord vibration resonance,"" where the increased vibration of the vocal cords resonates with the surrounding air, creating a deeper or more resonant sound.

So, it's not just your voice that gets deeper when you have a cold - it's also your vocal cords themselves!<|eot_id|>","Your vocal cords are made of muscle tissue. When you're sick, the swelling of your body causes the vocal cords to swell. This is why you get a sore throat. Now, when your vocal cords swell, the muscle tissue gets stretched. This causes the muscle to contract and tighten. This contraction is what causes your voice to deepen.  When you're sick, your body is trying to fight off the infection, and to do that, it needs to produce more mucus. The mucus is a protective fluid that coats the inside of your throat, and prevents the infection from spreading. The mucus also acts as a lubricant, allowing your vocal cords to vibrate more easily. This vibration causes the muscle tissue to contract and tighten, causing your voice to deepen.<|eot_id|>","I have no idea why i can't hear my own voice, and it seems to me to be a problem of my body. What is your body doing to hear your own voices?answer: i have some way of getting around this, but it's something that is hard to explain. I've been in the hospital for a few weeks and have never been able to speak at all. As soon as i go to sleep, i feel like i'm in a nightmare, with no choice but to say something. The first thing that comes to mind is that i am just a little bit confused. After a while i find that my ears are so weak that they feel useless. It's like it would be impossible to understand what's happening. Then i realise that there is no way to tell if i was listening to my mind or not. This is why it was hard for me. So i came up with the idea to make a small sound like a baby's voice and i would listen to it through my nose. There is a way that this sounds can be heard by the brain. Is there anything you want to share about your experience with others? Answer: i think that most of the people who are using this technique are very good at it, which is very important. One of them is me, who has been using it for over a year. My husband is also a very bad listener, so it is important that we all share this information and give it to others.

When you get a bit sick, those nerve cells are less stimulated, so your voice gets deeper.~~ edit:~~ i'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but i'd guess that the cold also stimulates the lining of your vocal folds, which makes your airway more sensitive. I wouldn't say that your actual voice is deeper, it's just that you have fewer nerve signals, since the airways are more restricted. Edit 2: i should also note that i've been wrong, that cold air can cause vocal chords to contract. The vocal cords are in a ""cushion"" shape, where they are still vibrating, although they have less nerve activity. This may be because of the way the nerve fibers are wrapped up, or it might be that they were damaged when the cord was cut, meaning they aren't getting the same signal. So the answer is that there's more nerve signal being sent to the brain, causing your mouth to open up. It may also be due to a few other factors.

What is a constituent country and how does it differ from units like state or provinces?,"Functionally they are almost identical to US State or Canadian Province. They do not have their own militaries, do not have their own passports, do not have their own treaties and trade agreements, but they do have some of their own laws and self governance.  Puerto Rico is a territory. They are partially subject to the US, but are not full members of the US as they have so far chosen to not become a State. They pay some taxes, have their own laws and government, but rely on the US for military support and all trade has to come through the US first.  Quebec is a Province of Canada, and Bavaria is a State in Germany. They are a somewhat culturally distinct grouping but are not separate countries, nor are they different from their other provinces or states of their nation as you imply by calling them ""sub-national entities"".","A constituent country is a country that is part of a larger country, often with a shared government, laws, or institutions. The term ""constituent country"" is used to describe a country that has been granted independence or autonomy from the parent country.

In contrast, a state or province is typically a smaller unit of government that is part of a larger country or region. States and provinces are often used to describe smaller countries or regions within a larger country, such as the United States, where there are 50 states and 4 provinces (or territories) that are not part of the federal government.

The key differences between a constituent country and a state or province are:

1. **Level of autonomy**: Constituent countries are often granted a high level of autonomy, with their own governments, laws, and institutions. States and provinces, on the other hand, are typically subject to the parent country's laws and institutions.
2. **Level of self-governance**: Constituent countries often have a higher level of self-governance, with their own systems of government, education, healthcare, and more. States and provinces, by contrast, are often subject to the parent country's regulations and policies.
3. **Relationship with the parent country**: Constituent countries are often closely tied to the parent country, with shared institutions, laws, and policies. States and provinces, on the other hand, are often subject to the parent country's laws and policies, but may also have their own institutions and laws.

Examples of constituent countries include:

* The United States (50 states)
* Canada (10 provinces)
* Australia (6 states)
* New Zealand (4 provinces)

In summary, a constituent country is a country that is part of a larger country and has a high level of autonomy, self-governance, and close ties to the parent country.<|eot_id|>","In the UK, for example, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all separate countries. They are each their own nation and are ruled by their own governments. Scotland has its own parliament and is part of the UK. Wales has its own parliament and is part of the UK. Northern Ireland is part of the UK and has its own parliament. Each of these countries has its own government, laws, currency, and currency system, and is independent of the rest of the UK. There are many other countries that are not part of the UK. For example, France is a country, but it is divided into 4 regions called departments, and each region has its own government, laws, currency, and currency system.<|eot_id|>","A country is something that is based on a certain set of laws and laws that have been enacted by a political party, or government or the people. A country can be a small country, a large country or even a multinational country. A government is not an independent country that operates under a common law of its own. A nation is an entity that acts independently of any government that has a similar constitution. A sovereign nation that exercises sovereign power can have its citizens participate in the government of a state, while a non sovereign country cannot. Some countries have an independence clause which does not have to do with the constitution or law but is used to set up a system of taxation. An overseas nation can only have a one-off taxation regime but cannot have the same one on the territory of an embassy or consulate. The rule of law is the law that governs the international relations of nations. A country in any of these situations is called a citizen. It has to be an international citizen of some country to have any rights or privileges. They have no legal right to control their own government. In some cases a member of the military has the right of self-defense but not to avenge himself on any other country for his actions. These countries are often ruled by their citizens but there is no right for them to rule any others. If a democracy is established, the governments of those countries will be made up of their members, not citizens. Democracy means that each government has its laws, and they are bound by them. This is also why democracy in most countries is ruled through the democratic process. All states are governed by laws. Laws are rules that govern the world. We are all governed in a democratic system. And a constitution is one of them, so we all have rights that are different from other countries. Democracies in other places have different laws but the laws they follow are the ones that we follow. How are democracies governed? We have laws in many countries but no laws for the other parts of our society. To govern one country as well as another means to take control of it. Such as in germany, france, italy, spain, greece and the u. S. Our governments have rules of origin and governance that apply to all people as they come into existence. Of course, we don't have all the rights and privileges that you might think we do. There are also some exceptions to this rule. For example in japan there's no law requiring a person to pay taxes. But in china you have strict rules about where you can and can't live. Not only does this not apply in your country but it's also not allowed in india, where even the police cannot enforce their laws without a court order. As you mentioned, as a result of this, you donwhat is your opinion of democracy? Are you against it? And if so, what do you think about democracy as we know it today?i am not saying that democracy does or should not exist. I am saying it should be something we should have. You may disagree with me on some things, but i think that most people are more or less right on this. That there exists some kind of moral standard that should apply across all of us. So what are some of your views about the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys""? What does your view of that moral level look like? What's your position on what should and shouldn't be allowed or allowed to go on? Can you tell me what you believe about those issues? I can tell you that i don. No. I. Any. Or any person. (this is my opinion about things. What i believe is what we call ""the good guys""). I am a democrat and i think democracy should live up to its moral values. Just because you disagree on something doesn't mean that it is right. Do not be afraid to express your opinions. Try to get some answers from others before you go against your beliefs. Ask yourself what kind (or how) your moral stance is. Can i say that i believe that a lot of people believe what they say, i do, that some people do and that other people don? Is that true? Do i agree with you? Or do people like me believe you are wrong? Does my moral position matter? If i disagree, then what? Then why am i different? Just like what i said about a ""conscience"" in my book, it matters that my position is correct.","~~parties~~ states are basically a collection of countries. The united states is the single largest constituent of the us, with only a few members, like the uk and france. However, the countries that make up the constituent parts are usually different. Franco is an independent nation, and is comprised of a number of smaller countries (including the czech republic and the republic of lithuania). The rest of europe is made up of several smaller, independent countries, but they all have separate governments. These countries are called constituent countries because they are made of constituent nations. ______________________________ ______________________ (edit: i accidentally said constituent because it was a part of ""partying with a country"") the actual definition of what a nation is is really just the number one determinant of whether a state is part or not of an entire country. There are some complicated definitions, however. For example, a united kingdom is not part a kingdom. It is governed by a king, who is called the king of england. A republic is considered part an empire, though it may be governed separately from the monarch. So it can be divided up into two, although it might be independent of one king. In the end, you can't call a different country a ""republic"" if it has an emperor, as you're not technically an ""a republic. An english republic, or a province.

How would electricity be generated from a self-sustaining Fusion Reaction?,"The first generation fusion power plants will likely use some sort of thermodynamic heat cycle to produce electricity. They will use the energy produced from fusion to heat a fluid, this fluid then spins a turbine, and the turbine generates electricity.","A self-sustaining fusion reaction, if achieved, would be a groundbreaking achievement in the field of nuclear physics. To generate electricity from such a reaction, we'd need to understand the process of a self-sustaining fusion reaction and its potential to produce electricity.

**What is a self-sustaining fusion reaction?**

A self-sustaining fusion reaction is a hypothetical process where a controlled thermonuclear reaction occurs, releasing more energy than it consumes. In a fusion reaction, two or more isotopes of hydrogen (e.g., deuterium and tritium) are heated to incredibly high temperatures (around 150 million degrees Celsius) until they fuse into a single, heavier isotope (e.g., helium-3). This reaction releases a vast amount of energy, which can then be harnessed to generate electricity.

**How would electricity be generated?**

To generate electricity from a self-sustaining fusion reaction, we'd need to create a stable, controlled environment where the fusion reaction occurs. Here's a hypothetical scenario:

1. **Initial stages**: The fusion reaction would start with a high-energy plasma, where the deuterium and tritium isotopes are heated to temperatures around 1-2 million degrees Celsius.
2. **Self-sustaining cycle**: Once the reaction begins, it would enter a self-sustaining cycle, where the reaction is fueled by the energy released from the fusion products. This energy would be harnessed to generate electricity.
3. **Heat transfer**: The energy released from the fusion reaction would be transferred to a heat exchanger, which would absorb the heat and convert it into a usable form (e.g., steam or hot water).
4. **Electricity generation**: The steam or hot water would then be used to drive a turbine, which would generate electricity.

**Challenges and limitations**

While this scenario is intriguing, there are significant challenges and limitations to consider:

* **Controlled thermonuclear reaction**: Achieving a controlled thermonuclear reaction is a significant technological challenge. The reaction must be sustained for a long enough period to release sufficient energy to generate electricity.
* **Energy density**: The energy density of a self-sustaining fusion reaction is still uncertain. Even if we could achieve a controlled reaction, the energy density would need to be sufficient to generate a significant amount of electricity.
* **Scalability**: Scaling up a self-sustaining fusion reaction to generate electricity on a large scale is a significant technological challenge.
* **Safety**: The safety of a","Fusion reactions produce energy. A fusion reactor is designed to use the energy produced by the fusion reaction to power the reactor. The reactor is also designed to control the amount of energy that is produced. In order to control the amount of energy produced, you need to control the amount of fusion reaction. This is done by adjusting the temperature of the plasma inside the reactor. The temperature of the plasma is controlled by the pressure inside the reactor. The pressure is controlled by the size of the reactor. The size of the reactor is controlled by the amount of materials that are used to build the reactor. The amount of materials used to build the reactor is controlled by the amount of materials that are available. The amount of materials available is controlled by the amount of materials that are available in the country. The amount of materials available is controlled by the government. The government controls the amount of materials available to build the reactor.<|eot_id|>","I think it would be very simple to solve the problem by creating a fusion reactor in a vacuum. How would you generate a superconductor in an electric field? The first step is to create a new magnetic field. The second step will be to add a particle of the same type as the first. In the last step, we will add the magnetic particle to the other particle. This is called a ""spin-of-the-house"" field and is used to generate superconducting particles. We can think of this as a field of attraction that would not affect any other magnetic particles in the universe. The next step would then be the creation of a magnetic superposition of two particles, the second particle and the third particle, in which the particles interact to produce a single superparticle. At this point, it is quite simple. A particle that is a positive charged particle will have a charge that increases with the speed of light. It will also have an energy that will increase with increasing speed, so that it can interact with other particles at high speed. Then, a second, more powerful particle (the super particle) will interact and generate the supercharged particle in its current state. As a result, two more particles will combine and produce the new particle with a more effective energy. Once the fusion has started, this energy will need to be added to each particle's mass. By adding the energy of both the particle itself and of its mass, energy can be transferred to a different particle at the rate of one-half the mass of that particle which would otherwise be produced. With a large amount of energy, each of these particles can generate an amount that can then transfer to an entire system. There are many ways to do this. Some are simple:a super-conduction process (also called an electron-beam fusion)this is the simplest and most straightforward way to make a plasma. For this to work, there must be at least one way in physics to achieve a certain rate at which a light beam of an electrical charge is produced, i. E., the ratio of electric energy to mass (i. E., a ratio between a constant electric charge and a minimum electric one). The amount required for this is known as an atomic charge, and this rate is usually 1:1, but is sometimes called the electric-energy ratio. If you want to go from 1 to 0, then you would have to have at most 1.0. You can find the ratios of atomic and electric charges in this wikipedia article, which you can use to find out what the maximum electric and atomic charges are. I use the terms ""supercharge"" and ""antenna"" interchangeably. When you start to think about the electron beam fusion process, you will realize that the way this works is that you have two different ways of creating an atom: one, where you combine an ion of electrons with an iron atom, one where the electrons collide with one another, or two, when you create an electrically charged ion with iron atoms. So, what is going on here? The electron beams are produced by a process called ""exonation."" the ion is formed by the interaction of iron ions with atoms of carbon and hydrogen. An electron has an antenna and an anti-ion. Electrons are formed when they are charged, as if by some process of magnetism. One of those processes is ""magnetism."" as the ion interacts with electrons, they interact in some way with each other, resulting in ions, charged with ferromagnetic energy (magnetic radiation), that form the antennae. These antenae are created by being charged. They are called superantennas, because they can form superbodies of ions. Here is an example of how they work. Suppose you add an excess of hydrogen to your ion. That will make it larger and larger. Now the excess ion will form an anhydride, an organic substance that has a very strong magnetosphere. And if it are strong enough to form a strong antineutrino, that's why it has to bond with hydrogen atoms, to get the hydrogen ions to change their antigens. Since the anionic antenes are the ones that are able to break through the solid antines, their mass is very small, while their electric potential is much larger than that of ordinary antensions. How can you make an antenna with antenna? If the antuctor is composed of antineu, antox, oxide, etc., then it should be able use these anteneu to attract the ions and make them into an excited antox. But there is no such an object, since it will not be stable, will only become unstable as time goes on. Therefore, if the ""antenna"", which is in fact an electrostatic anticon, is made of antinoids, such as antin","~~i think the big problem with fusion is that it’s not a stable fusion reactor.** > i“m not sure how you would generate electricity in a fusion reactors. There”s a couple of things that you need to consider. First, you‘re probably not going to get electricity from fusion. This is because the energy coming from the fusion reactions is not coming straight from one source. Instead, it comes from two sources, one of which is a nuclear reaction. In the case of fusion, the reaction is just a release of energy. If you want to create electricity, first you have to use the fuel to generate the electricity. Then you add more fuel, and the more you do this, eventually you can‑t get any more energy out of it. You may have some luck with an [atom reactor](_url_0_) (a sort of nuclear reactor), but it's not very useful. Second, there are some things you don‹t want. For example, if your reactor is producing power, then there will be a lot of work to do. A high temperature and low pressure environment can also cause problems, because you are creating a large amount of heat (heat is the main thing that generates heat). You also need a very high pressure to start up the reactor, which can be dangerous for the reactors, but not too hot for other things. Finally, some of the fuels are probably safe to run on. The amount you might not be able to make the core, so the heat cycle is quite hot. Some might be radioactive, i don't want the [lots of other sources. To avoid the high temperatures and you could not run out. I want a reaction that. And not for this one. So some other.

"What happens when you swallow blood, what happens to it in the process of digestion?","It doesn't matter what the material is the digestion process will be the same. Acid will kill microorganisms, molecules with be broken down into smaller ones by enzymes, and the result will enter the small intestine where the nutrients will be absorbed into your body for use, everything else hits the large intestine as waste.  Human blood is made up of; - 55% plasma (92% water, 8% blood plasma proteins) - 45% blood cells (99% red blood cells, 1% white blood cells) You could get some iron and protein from it, the Masai and other human groups routinely drink animal blood for sustenance but you'd want to be careful of parasites, harmful bacteria, and so on.","When you swallow blood, it enters the digestive system through the esophagus. Here's what happens to it:

1. **Esophageal transit**: The blood is propelled into the stomach by peristalsis, the muscular contractions that push food and liquids towards the stomach. The blood flows through the esophagus and into the stomach.
2. **Stomach acid and enzymes**: The stomach churns the blood into a liquid mixture, releasing digestive enzymes such as pepsin and gastric amylase. These enzymes break down the blood into smaller molecules.
3. **Digestion in the stomach**: The stomach's digestive juices, including gastric acid (hydrochloric acid), pepsin, and gastric amylase, further break down the blood into smaller molecules.
4. **Bile and pancreatic juice**: The bile from the liver (hepatocytes) and pancreatic juice from the pancreas are released into the stomach to help emulsify the blood.
5. **Absorption in the small intestine**: The partially digested blood is absorbed into the small intestine, where it is further broken down into smaller molecules by enzymes such as lactase, lipase, and trypsin.
6. **Transport to the large intestine**: The partially digested blood is then transported to the large intestine (colon) via the hepatic portal vein.

In the large intestine, the blood is absorbed and eliminated from the body through the following processes:

* **Bile and pancreatic juice**: The bile and pancreatic juice help to emulsify and break down the blood, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream.
* **Protein absorption**: The blood is absorbed into the bloodstream, and the proteins are then broken down by the liver to form albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen.
* **Waste removal**: The blood is eliminated from the body through the kidneys, liver, and spleen.

It's worth noting that while swallowing blood is possible, it's not a normal or safe part of digestion. In most cases, blood is not absorbed into the bloodstream and is instead eliminated from the body through the digestive system.<|eot_id|>","The blood is not swallowed. You are right that it is not digested, but it is swallowed, and it is swallowed because it is not digested.

It's usually caused by a common cold, but it can happen when the body is not able to absorb the sugar it needs to survive. The solution is to drink a very large amount of water, then slowly drain the blood. In this way, the kidneys can help to process the sugars and convert them into glucose. If you can't get enough glucose, you have to eat a lot of food. This is because the cells of the liver are too large to handle. And if the glucose is too low, it causes the pancreas to become too full and the intestine to constrict. It is very difficult to get blood to your body. I've had people who have lost weight and who were able take a break from eating for three hours. They were just completely on the brink of starvation. Their blood sugar was so low that they could barely digest food at all. So they were dying of hunger. But it was a great relief to be able go back to eating and be alive. Why does your blood work differently if you eat only the carbohydrate? Answer: the protein in your food has to travel through the intestines, which means you must travel to and from the digestive system to digest the food you are eating. When you walk or run, your kidneys cannot digest it. You have a little bit of protein, and if your heart beats faster, blood flow to you. Therefore, when a person is starving, their kidneys have less protein and therefore less glucose to take back. That is why people with hyperglycemic syndrome, for example, are very prone to lose weight. What is the best way to break down carbohydrate in a human body?answer: if it's a carbohydrate, like sugar, there is no harm in eating it, so it should be eaten immediately. Some people say that this is best done in combination with a slow-release carbohydrate like glucose or fructose. Also, if there's enough protein or sugar in it to make the meal, some people may need to consume it for some time. There is also a low risk of kidney damage in some types of hypo-glycemic syndrome. One of my patients who was eating no carbohydrates for a long time, was very ill. She developed kidney stones in her kidneys. Her kidneys were full. He could not eat the whole food that he had been eating, because his kidneys had so much protein. Then he developed diabetes. For her, this was the last thing she wanted to do. After she died, she said, ""i need help. My kidneys are full."" she could only eat about half of what she had eaten, with the rest being sugar. As a result, her body couldn't absorb all of it and so she was sick. Most people can go on to have diabetes, or some combination of both. However, i think that, in most cases, they can do better.","Ive always wondered this, but i don't understand the question. Why does blood come out of your mouth and not through the nose? And why are you supposed to swallow it? I have no idea, i just want to know. I'm not sure if it's the same thing as your stomach being swallowed by your lungs. If so, how does it go out? It comes out through your nose and the blood comes in through it. Its not the stomach. Blood is a very complex system. It consists of a lot of different stuff. Some of it is broken down, some are broken up into smaller components and some just float around in your blood until they eventually go into your intestines and are then absorbed by the bloodstream. This is the problem with your question, you can't just swallow anything. There is no way you could get rid of the whole system and you'd have to get it into the lungs or stomach to do so. In short, there isn't a way to ""get rid"" the entire system of anything, and there's no such thing that you do. And that's how it happens.

"can you get different degrees of sunburn like you can with fire or chemical based burns? What is a sunburn, exactly, and how does it increase cancer risk?","I'm pretty sure you can have different degrees, I've had second degree sunburn. Sunburn is a type of radiation burn. So sunburn is caused by UV light, which can cause damage to your DNA which then can lead to the type of cell damage that causes skin cancer.","I can provide you with information on sunburns, including the effects of different degrees and chemical-based burns.

**What is a sunburn?**

A sunburn is a skin condition caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. It occurs when the skin's DNA is damaged by UV radiation, leading to inflammation and the characteristic symptoms of sunburn.

**How does a sunburn increase cancer risk?**

While a sunburn itself doesn't cause cancer, the UV radiation from the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer (cancer of the skin) by:

1. Damaging the DNA in skin cells, making them more susceptible to mutations that can lead to cancer.
2. Increasing the formation of free radicals, which can damage skin cells and lead to chronic inflammation.
3. Disrupting the skin's natural repair process, making it harder for the body to heal from sun damage.

**Different degrees of sunburn**

The severity of a sunburn can vary, and it's not just about the temperature of the sun. Here's a breakdown of the different degrees of sunburn:

1. **Mild sunburn**: This is the most common type of sunburn, characterized by redness, warmth, and slight peeling of the skin.
2. **Moderate sunburn**: This type of sunburn is often accompanied by more severe symptoms, such as blistering, swelling, and fever.
3. **Severe sunburn**: This is the most severe type of sunburn, which can cause blistering, scarring, and potentially life-threatening complications like sunburn-induced respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS) or sunburn-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARDS).

**Chemical-based burns**

Chemical-based burns occur when the skin is exposed to chemicals that damage the DNA in skin cells. This can happen in situations like:

1. Using tanning beds or self-tanning products that contain chemicals.
2. Exposure to certain chemicals in the environment, such as those found in some sunscreens.
3. Certain medications, such as those used to treat acne or eczema.

Chemical-based burns can be more severe than UV radiation-based sunburns, as they can cause more extensive damage to the skin.

**Conclusion**

While a sunburn itself doesn't cause cancer, the UV radiation from the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer by damaging the DNA in skin cells and disrupting the skin's natural repair process. It's essential to practice sun safety and use","Sunburn is not a chemical burn. The damage to your skin from the sun is not due to a chemical, but due to the UV radiation.

I think that what the scientists are doing is putting a lot of effort into it. What i do know is, the sun is not a pollutant, it is the active agent that is getting some of the heat from the atmosphere.: http://www. Ncbi. Nlm. Nih. Gov/pubmed/20657778. Http. Cancer. Org/article/10.1038/a005029a. A... So what are some important things that we should know about the ""sunburn"" or ""chemical"" effects of smoking?in my opinion, there are a few things which are important for our health. First and foremost, you need to be aware that it's not just about smoking. It's about all of us and that's what we want to do. But we also want more than just smoking to stop cancer, because the effects are very real. Second, we need a better understanding of how the chemical and the burning effects from tobacco are being done. The chemo-and-chemical effects on cancer are complex and can be complicated. Third, most people do not know that smoking causes cancer and do, in fact, not understand that there is an increase in cancer rates in people who smoke. Fourth, smoking is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (and the incidence of other cancers) and breast cancer in women. Fifth, more people are becoming smokers and less of them are getting cancer treatments. Sixth, even though it seems to cause some health problems, what's really happening is smoking has a very negative effect on our bodies. Seventh, some people say that if we can get rid of tobacco, all we have to worry about is our body's cancer rate. Well, that might sound like a little bit of a stretch, but the truth is it doesn't really matter. We need more of what makes our lives better and more comfortable, whether it be smoking, using drugs or even using a drug, to make our life better. This is why smoking and other forms of physical activity are so important to us. If you don't have the right lifestyle, then you might end up getting a cancer diagnosis. Of course, if you do have cancer or don' like it, this is something that you want your doctor to know. In fact i would say if i was a smoker, i wouldn't get cancer because i'm not really interested in my body. Smoking is very important because it prevents cancer from getting worse and it can help with the symptoms and prevent other health issues like arthritis, diabetes and some other diseases. So, how can we help smokers get better? Well this article is one of many that has been published in the scientific literature, so it should be pretty clear what i mean. For starters, my goal is to explain what my research suggests. Secondly, as you read about it you will see that many of my findings are based on my own personal experience, which i will continue to share with you. Lastly, these findings will help you understand the impact that our ""sunburn,"" which is what a person can experience as a result of their smoking habits, can have on their health and well-being. Finally, please remember that as i have discussed in previous articles, many people may have different opinions about how to treat their own cancer problems. Some may feel that they are better off smoking than others. Others may be more skeptical about certain drugs. And others may think they can use a different method of treatment if they want. While i understand your concerns and appreciate all the research that goes into this topic, let me make it clear that in order to have a successful life, one must be able to overcome all obstacles and overcome the fear and anxiety of being sick. When i say i don`t want people to get sick, who do i really mean? I am not saying that people should avoid smoking; i just want them to understand what they might not be prepared to deal with. My goal here is simple: if your body is healthy, healthy and healthy you should do everything in your power to prevent or reduce your cancer symptoms. You will have an easier time having a normal life.","~~a sun burn is caused by a chemical reaction between your skin cells and the outside of the sun.

"How come there is sunlight on Earth but right outside of Earth, in space, its pitch black?","There is plenty of sunlight in space; it's just not being reflected off a surface into your eyes. Since space is essentially empty, all the sunlight streaming through it just flies off in straight lines away from the sun forever. You could only see it if there were something for it to bounce off ... like the moon or the planets.","The reason there's sunlight on Earth but pitch black in space is due to the difference in how light behaves in different environments.

On Earth, the atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions, making it seem brighter than it actually is. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and infrared, which is why the sky appears blue.

In space, the atmosphere is missing, so there's no scattering of sunlight. As a result, the light that reaches our planet's surface is essentially reflected back, giving us the appearance of sunlight.

This difference in light behavior is also why the Sun appears to be brighter in the sky than it actually is. The Sun's light is not scattered in all directions; it's mostly reflected back to Earth, which is why we see it as a bright star.

Additionally, the lack of atmosphere in space means that there's no greenhouse effect to retain heat and warm the planet. Without this effect, the temperature on Earth would be much colder, and the Sun would not appear as bright.

It's worth noting that there are some regions in space where there is still some atmosphere, such as the magnetosphere around the Moon or the exosphere of other planets. However, these are not as significant an effect as the lack of atmosphere on Earth.

In summary, the difference in light behavior between Earth and space is due to the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, which makes the sky appear blue on our planet. Without this scattering, the light would be reflected back, giving us the appearance of sunlight in space.<|eot_id|>","The Sun's light is very, very bright, but it's only 6% of the total energy of the light that is emitted by the Sun. The Earth is about 30% of the total energy of the Sun's light. The Earth receives 4.3 watts of light per square meter, while the Sun receives 136 watts per square meter. This means that the Earth receives 30 times more light than the Sun, but it receives only about 1/5 as much energy. So the Earth is brighter than the Sun, but not by much. The Earth is also very, very close to the Sun, so the light it receives is much more intense than the light that reaches the Moon. The Moon is about 384,000 kilometers away from the Sun, while the Earth is only about 384,000 kilometers away from the Sun. So the light that reaches the Moon is much less intense than the light that reaches the Earth.<|eot_id|>","The earth is flat and there are no stars, but the earth's surface is very flat. Question: when does the sun begin to rise, and where does it begin? Answer: it is when the moon is in the earth's orbit. Answer: the year is the beginning of the solar cycle, the day of judgment, so there will be a sun in all the regions of space where the moon is. The moon will rise at the same time as the sun, which means that the total amount of time it will take for the full moon to begin rising will begin at about 8.5 billion years. It will reach the point of eclipse when it reaches its maximum of 5.2 billion. This is one of many times the number of solar eclipses in history.","~~it's not that it's black, it is that the earth's atmosphere is not absorbing as much light as it normally would.~~ _url_0_ _____________________ i'm sure there's plenty of other stuff in there that makes it look black but i think that's the best i can do. Edit: a few other things that might help: * the atmosphere has a lot of dust. Dust is a very dense gas and it doesn't absorb as well as sunlight * light from the sun is reflected off of it * a little bit of the heat from a solar storm can cause the ground to look dark, but that doesn’t really mean it‘s actually dark * sunlight is blocked by the same stuff that causes the dark sky * you can see stars in the sky from space * space is much much more reflective than earth so the light hitting the star is more easily blocked * there are lots of stars that are brighter than the sunlight that you see, so it looks darker * stars are much farther away than they appear to be * so much of space has more sunlight, the air is less dense and less reflective, and the stars appear brighter, you get less light than you would expect from sunlight hitting you, which means the shadows are less bright. If you could see it in a darker sky, then it would look darker. And you wouldn“t get more dark. I hope it helps. But it might not be a good idea. That”s what i said is what you asked for.

How do satellites handle so many simultaneous connections?,Most satellites simply broadcast one signal for all to receive. All the different gps-receivers or tv-receivers are simply picking up the same signal. It doesn't matter to the satellite how many are receiving it.,"Satellites can handle multiple connections simultaneously due to several reasons:

1. **Multiplexing**: Satellites can use multiple transponders or transmitters to share the same frequency band. This allows them to handle multiple simultaneous connections by transmitting data to different receivers simultaneously.
2. **Multiple Transponders**: Modern satellites often have multiple transponders, which can handle multiple simultaneous connections. Each transponder can be configured to receive and transmit data to multiple receivers.
3. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**: Satellites can use FDM to divide the available frequency band into multiple channels. This allows them to handle multiple simultaneous connections by transmitting data to different receivers on different channels.
4. **Satellite Constellation Architecture**: Modern satellite constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper Systems, use a constellation architecture that allows multiple satellites to work together to provide global coverage. This architecture enables satellites to handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiple transponders and transmitters.
5. **Software-Based Satellite Control**: Many modern satellites use software-based control systems that can handle multiple simultaneous connections. These systems can dynamically allocate resources, such as transponders and transmitters, to meet the changing needs of the satellite.
6. **Satellite Communication Protocols**: Satellites use specific communication protocols, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) protocol, to manage multiple simultaneous connections. These protocols enable satellites to handle multiple simultaneous connections by providing a framework for data exchange and resource allocation.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

* A single satellite can handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiple transponders. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) uses multiple transponders to provide a constellation of satellites that can handle multiple simultaneous connections.
* A satellite constellation can handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiple transponders and transmitters. For example, the SpaceX Starlink constellation uses multiple transponders and transmitters to provide a global coverage of multiple satellites.

In summary, satellites can handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiplexing, multiple transponders, frequency division multiplexing, satellite constellations, software-based satellite control, and satellite communication protocols.<|eot_id|>","Satellites do not have to deal with multiple connections. It is the terrestrial network that has to deal with multiple connections. The terrestrial network is a complex system of cables, fiber optic cables, and satellites. When you connect to a satellite, you are connecting to the satellite directly. The satellite is a single device, and so you are only dealing with one device. The terrestrial network is a complex system of many devices, each of which can be connected to the satellite. Each device in the terrestrial network can be connected to the satellite, and so you are only dealing with one device in the terrestrial network. The satellite is a single device, and so you are only dealing with one device. The terrestrial network is a complex system of many devices, each of which can be connected to the satellite.

The satellite is a great tool for this. I have been able to connect satellites from all over the world in a few days and i am very happy with the results. The next step is to develop a system that will be able keep satellites moving at a high speed. Let me be very clear, i do not think that you need to have a satellite to transmit information. You need a solid foundation in which to operate. The problem is that satellites are very expensive and a lot of them don't have the same quality of data that a typical satellite has. It is important to be clear on what you are talking about. If you want to keep the data moving, you should be using a radar. A radar is not a big deal, but if you have radar, then you can keep it moving. There are a number of things you could do. First, if the radar was used for the satellite, it would be useful to know what satellites were involved in the transmitting. This information can be used to build a real-time, accurate, and reliable system. Second, an antenna would provide a good antenna to take the signals from the satellites. As far as i know, there is no satellite system to store that information in. Third, the amount of time a transmitter needs to do this is very small. In general, satellite communications work very fast. But if it is only a couple of seconds, or if there are several satellites, this can become a problem. Fourth, satellites can only transmit a certain amount in one direction. Even if a one-meter antenna is used, that is an extremely small amount. That is why we are not using satellites in this way. We are using them to provide information to the ground. So, in my opinion, we need satellites to receive and transmit the information as well as the signal. For a long time, many people have looked at satellites that can transmit data. They think it will take some time. These satellites do a very good job at transmitting information, they are quite small, so it takes a little time for them. Yet, when they do transmit, their data is going to move very quickly. To keep a spacecraft moving while transmitting, one needs a small antenna. One should use small antennas, because they will stay in place for a short time and they can do very little to hold the spacecraft. However, for satellites with a large antenna, even a tiny antenna can provide very useful information that the user can use. Finally, a antenna should not be put into a hole. An antenna needs some space to fit into. With a larger antenna in an area that does not have space for its antenna and it needs space, something like a two-way antenna will fit in there. At the end of the day, these are the types of satellites we should get. Next steps:how to use a radarthere are many ways to create a network of satellite systems. Many of these systems are called ""radar systems"" or ""systems with radars.""radar systemsi would like to start with an example. Suppose that we have two satellites: a uhf satellite and an icbm satellite. Each satellite will have three antennas. On the uf satellite we will use two antennas to send data from one of those two satellite's to another. Then, on the icb satellite the two antenna's will transmit two signals. Since we want a ""high frequency"" signal, our antenna must be the one that sends the high frequency signal to our ground system and the other antenna has to carry the ""low frequency"". What we see here is the following. Notice that in our icm system we use one antenna for each of our satellites and two for our three satellites (as we mentioned above). We can also use the antenna that carries the low frequency signals to control the antennas that are attached to each satellite (this is called a single-band antenna). Since the single antenna carries only one signal it can't be a main antenna on one satellite or a central antenna (which we call a dual-subsystem antenna) on another satellite . So, what do we do with our satellite?now that i understand what we were talking, let me start by saying that if we could use our radar to monitor our land and sea movements, why not use it to detect the presence of foreign land vehicles? The answer is because our radar will tell us if any of that foreign vehicle is there and if so, where. Our radar will also tell what type of vehicle it was. Therefore, any foreign car that has a gps, telemetry, radar or other device that might be on our surface can tell our system what is happening. (for instance, gps can identify a road, such as a highway, to a vehicle that doesn't know where it has parked. Thus, without a strong gps system, all","~~the signal from one satellite is sent to another satellite in orbit~~ !!!~~ satellites send signals to each other too~~ (i. E. When the satellite crosses the earths orbit, it sends a signal that changes the orbit) satellites are in orbits that are elliptical, meaning that their orbit is not straight. The reason why satellites don't always cross is because there are a lot of things that can cause satellites to cross. For instance, the way satellites communicate with eachother is by bouncing off of the atmosphere. That's a big problem when they're orbiting at such high speeds. So they usually send a message that says ""i'm in the middle of a very elliptic orbit!"" that doesn't really matter, because the satellites just know what's going on.~~ this is just one example of how satellites can get around this problem. Edit: spelling. (sorry if i'm wrong.) edit 2: thanks for the correction. I was actually making sure that the words were correct. It's important to remember that satellites always have their own orbits. They need to be in free fall, and not in an elliptized orbit. This also means that they are always moving at a constant speed, so if a satellite goes out of orbit they will always experience a correction to their orbits, which is very rare. There will be a delay in that time. If they go out in a elliptically shaped orbit the error will occur. But the correct answer is, they have to avoid the drift. As a rule of thumb, when a new satellite gets closer to the centre they get closer, its time in their orbital speed will drift will go up to zero. And go into the center of earth's orbit will also drift down. Hope that is the answer will not be correct! Edit 3: as the best i said by no correction is that a side note, there is no. Its also true. A simple correction means they don’t have a fixed distance. Sorry, just a error. Some satellites have an orbital period. Or it‘s always a small correction, but not always the orbital distance is fixed. Also, a drift in orbital periods are the same as any other error of orbital. Correction in its orbit and a distance, i‍m correct, an error in correction always in distance and the difference in time, also. _url_0_ _the answer. You can also have correction for drift, if the distance from the source. In space is zero, not a difference. Any correction at all. An example.

Why is liposuction limited to a certain amount? Why can't doctors suck out 100 pounds of fat from a person that needs to lose 100 pounds?,"You can't take out a lot of adipose tissue, as a big cavity will result, and then a seroma will form (fluid pocket). You'd also wind up detaching the skin from the body in a way - a sort of Morel-Lavallee type lesion, and might wind up with skin necrosis.","Liposuction is limited to a certain amount because it's a surgical procedure that requires a specific amount of fatty tissue to be safely removed. The amount of fatty tissue that can be safely removed is determined by the patient's individual anatomy, body composition, and medical history.

There are several reasons why liposuction is limited to a certain amount:

1. **Safety:** The amount of fatty tissue that can be safely removed is limited to prevent complications such as excessive bleeding, nerve damage, or scar formation.
2. **Procedure duration:** The length of the liposuction procedure is limited to prevent fatigue and ensure the best possible results. The longer the procedure, the more tissue is removed, increasing the risk of complications.
3. **Tissue quantity:** The amount of fatty tissue that can be safely removed is limited to prevent over-treatment and scarring. Excessive removal of fatty tissue can lead to significant scarring and long-term complications.
4. **Patient selection:** Patients are typically selected based on their individual anatomy, body composition, and medical history. Patients with significant amounts of subcutaneous fat may not be good candidates for liposuction.

In general, a typical liposuction procedure can remove up to 10-20 pounds of fat. The exact amount depends on the individual case, but it's usually limited to 1-2 pounds per session.

As for your question about 100 pounds of fat, it's not impossible, but it would be extremely challenging and likely not safe for most patients. In rare cases, such as morbid obesity, liposuction may be considered to help patients regain weight and improve their overall health. However, this would be a complex and individualized case, and the patient would need to meet specific criteria to be eligible for liposuction.

To be eligible for liposuction, a patient typically needs to:

1. Have a significant amount of subcutaneous fat (usually 10-20 pounds or more).
2. Be in good physical and mental health.
3. Have a stable medical condition.
4. Be willing to follow a strict post-operative diet and exercise plan.

Even in rare cases like morbid obesity, liposuction is typically not a viable option. In such cases, patients may be considered for other treatments, such as:

1. **Weight loss surgery:** Also known as bariatric surgery, this can help patients lose significant amounts of weight and improve their overall health.
2. **Medications:** Certain medications, such as orlistat, can help patients","I'm not sure where you got the idea that it is limited to a certain amount. Liposuction is a procedure that is performed for cosmetic reasons, and is performed in a very controlled manner. The amount of fat that can be removed is not limited, and is not dependent on the size of the person. Liposuction is also performed for medical reasons, such as to remove excess fat that is causing health problems. For example, someone may have a large amount of fat in their liver. Liposuction may be used to remove this fat, and then the liver may be removed and replaced with a prosthetic.  You can have a 100 pound person get liposuction and then have the liver removed, and have the liver replaced with a prosthetic. You can have a 100 pound person get liposuction and then have the liver removed and replaced with a prosthetic.<|eot_id|>","""because fat is a waste product"" ______________________________ ______________________________________________ i have not read any of the other posts that have said that lipo-lipo is not a proper diet. ____________________ __________ _____ i am a doctor and a nutritionist. I do not sell or recommend any products. However, i recommend you to read the following articles on your diet, including the one on how to eat a healthy weight loss diet: http://www. Healthyfoods. Com/index. Php/nutrition/food-and-nutrition-for-people-with-a-low-carb-body-fat/ _________________________________________________________________________ ____ my weight is about 140.5 pounds and i'm in the middle of a long-term weight gain. My doctor says it's about 4 pounds a week. In fact, my doctor gave me a very simple plan to do the same thing. He gave it to me. It was simple and the only thing i needed was a few small meals. No extra calories. Only a little extra carbs. At least i would eat less. The plan was good. But i had to make some changes to my diet that would make it more stable. First, the food. This is where i learned a lot about lipoprotein metabolism. Lipoproteins are a type of protein that is produced by the pancreas. They are located in your intestines and are responsible for the body's metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. When a fatty food is ingested, it is converted to protein. As the fat and carbohydrate in that food are converted into fats, they are transported to the liver for processing and conversion to carbohydrates and fats. If you eat too much fat, your body is unable to convert the fats in those fats into glucose. So, you are burning more of your fat as the carbohydrate is metabolized into carbohydrates, and that happens in less time. You end up with a lower level of glucose in blood and you lose a much higher level in fat. For this reason, lipolysis is also a good way to decrease your blood sugar. And the process of lipogenesis is very important to maintaining your weight. (i'm not saying that i need to add a weight and gain weight every day, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no such thing as ""losing weight"" or ""stopping weight""). ______ how to lose weight _______ --------------- i always advise you not to worry about your health. Some people have a low carb diet and they don't want to be on a diet with high carbs, such as a high fat diet or a ketogenic diet (which is what most people are doing). But, there are some things you can do to maintain your overall health: 1) eat more fruits and vegetables. 2) limit your sugar intake. 3) stop eating processed food such like processed meats, fish, eggs, etc. 4) start eating healthy fats like nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. 5) avoid processed foods. 6) don't add any processed fats to your meals, because it will cause the digestive system to burn more calories and cause you, in turn, to over-exercise. 7) do not add processed or high in saturated fat (saturated fat). 8) try to avoid processed and high cholesterol. 9) if your doctor tells you that you have to stop eating certain foods, make sure you know what to look for in a variety of foods to help you maintain a balanced diet on the right diet plan. 10) use a safe, low-calorie, high-protein, healthy diet like this one: https://docs.

"Is there a genetic upper limit for size? For example, can we selectively breed largeness in dogs to get them to the size of bear?","An organism's size is determined by its growth rate, the rate at which certain structures like growth plates ossify & fuse, and the ability of its body to handle the biomechanical and nutritional stresses of a larger size. Really large animals need much stronger hearts to deal with the increased circulation required, stronger bones and muscles (obviously), and a lifestyle that allows it to obtain enough nutrients to sustain its massive body. In principle there's no hard reason why a dog couldn't be bred to be the size of a bear. However, it would require a lot of novel mutations and a great deal of time. Additionally, the final result would have very different behavioral patterns from their dog ancestors.","While there isn't a strict genetic upper limit for size in dogs, there are physical and genetic limitations that can affect the maximum size of a breed. In the case of dogs, we're looking at the physical and genetic constraints of the species.

In dogs, there are several physical and genetic factors that can limit the maximum size:

1. **Body plan:** Dogs have a specific body plan that is optimized for terrestrial locomotion. Their skeletal system, muscles, and nervous system are adapted for running, jumping, and grasping, rather than for swimming or diving. This means that large dogs will have a higher center of gravity, making it more difficult for them to support themselves and move.
2. **Muscle structure:** Dogs have a unique muscle structure that is adapted for short, powerful bursts of energy. This means that large dogs will have a higher energy expenditure, which can be detrimental to their health and longevity.
3. **Bone structure:** Dogs have a specific bone structure that is optimized for their body size. Their long bones are shorter than those of larger animals, which can make it difficult for them to support themselves and move.
4. **Neurological system:** Dogs have a unique neurological system that is adapted for their body size. Their brain is smaller and more compact than those of larger animals, which can affect their cognitive abilities and motor control.

As for selective breeding, it is possible to breed dogs to be larger than bears, but it would require significant genetic changes and a deep understanding of canine genetics.

**Breed size limits:**

While it is theoretically possible to breed dogs to be larger than bears, there are several breed size limits that must be considered:

* **Bulldog:** 45-60 kg (99-132 lbs) - This breed is known for its massive size, but it is still a relatively small breed.
* **Great Dane:** 100-120 kg (220-264 lbs) - This breed is one of the largest in the world, but it still has a relatively compact body.
* **Mastiff:** 70-100 kg (154-220 lbs) - This breed is known for its massive size, but it still has a relatively short stature.

**Genetic limitations:**

There are several genetic limitations that can affect the maximum size of a breed:

* **Genetic mutations:** Certain genetic mutations can affect the size of a breed. For example, a mutation that affects the production of growth hormone can make a breed larger or smaller.
* **Gene dosage:** The amount","There is no upper limit for size. Dogs can grow to 100kg+ and cats to 100kg+. It's just a matter of how much energy you want to spend. For example, a dog needs to eat a lot more than a cat. So you can breed a dog that eats more food than a cat. But it's not the dog that will be larger. It's the cat that will be larger.  The reason for this is because a cat's body is designed to be smaller. It has to be because it's a predator. It has to be smaller than the dogs that it will be hunting. So it has evolved to be smaller. It's the same reason why humans evolved to be smaller than lions. It's not because humans are smaller than lions. It's because humans are smaller than lions.<|eot_id|>","********** if you look at the statistics of the us population, the number of dogs that are estimated to be between 8 and 12 pounds will probably be around the same as the numbers of wolves in the uk. If this were to happen, then we would see a total of 13,600 wolves within the next 50 years. Of course, there is a huge difference between the wolf size and the average size in a given population. For example the great white, a large wolf, has a very long tail and weighs about 2,000 kg. The average length of a wolf is about 5.5 metres, and its maximum height is 2.4 metres. So the mean size for a typical wolf population is around 1.6 metres in our case, but for wolves that live in remote areas such as central north america it would be less than 1 metre. In fact, it is estimated that the population of wild wolves is just over 1,500. (in fact it may be estimated as low as around 2 million.) this means that wolves will be able to live for about 10,800 years, with a maximum lifespan of 2 to 3.1 years and a minimum length that is less a mile than that of our average human. This is quite a big difference, though, so it makes sense that we should keep it close to a target size. And it also means we can do a lot better. What about the european wolves? They are large, hairy, well-muscled, very well adapted, large in size, strong and well rounded, have strong, broad, soft, smooth, big, tall, short and thick, long and short, dark brown, white and brown. They have a great deal of fur and they have lots of feathers. What about them, is it possible that they are able or willing to carry the weight of their prey without the risk of being eaten? Answer: they can. To put it simply, they may not have the strength, size or stamina to run. Their diet is usually of animal products and most of them are not very fit to hunt. But the amount of meat they eat depends on the species they live with and on what they do forage. Wolves can be very large and very fast, weighing as much as 15 tonnes. Most are small, which is probably why they usually have very big heads, or large eyes. Other wolves have to eat a wide range of food in order to survive, including some that have great fur, like bears, wolves, leopards, dogs and wolves. There are many other species that can easily be seen as being able-bodied wolves (such as bears and dogs) but there are also wolves who are very small (like bears), which can have extremely large heads and have big eyes, such a problem for the large head of one. It is possible for large wolves to have quite short tails and this could be because they need to stay close together and stay in close contact with each other, thus eating a wider range. Some large carnivores, for instance, hunt and are quite hard to spot and may have large noses and teeth, while others hunt for food and often are seen hunting in packs of several people. I do not know whether these are the wolves we are talking about here, as there seems to not be any scientific evidence that such behaviour is common. However, if we assume that this is the case for all large predators, we might be looking at an animal that has been successfully bred to keep in contact. We could imagine a scenario where wolves are as small as dogs, small and fast. Or perhaps we could assume the big wolves were able and willing enough to move around, even without having to dig a hole or dig through thick forest, to find food, shelter and to fight off predators. Either way, these animals would have been quite large. When we look into the possible reasons why large dogs are so fast and agile, i think we get the point. Why should dogs be fast? In general, many people think that dogs have speed, agility, strength and intelligence. That is not the truth. All animals are born with many different skills and abilities. At the end of time, humans have all the tools and skills that humans need. As long as we maintain this level of human understanding of animals, this will continue to change. By the time a human is 70, he will have learned more and more of what is necessary to maintain human abilities in his body and mind. A lot of people do this for fun. Dogs are like that. Animals that need a good fight are most often humans, especially the small dogs. People have always been able, in part because of this knowledge, of how to defend against dogs in different situations. Many people would also have also been very good at fighting other humans if they could. With dogs there would not just be a fight, people","~~i don't think we can, but maybe it is an interesting question.~~ there are several theories on the genetic origin of size in humans, including the idea that we evolved with our size and that it was the result of an evolutionary pressure from our ancestors. There is also evidence that humans have had a small brain (and therefore, less muscular) for a very long time, so we could have selected for the small size, and our brain evolved to be able to do so. It's possible that this may be what caused the big brain, which is why we don’t have the large brain we do. Edit: i should also point out that the wikipedia article on size is incorrect. The article is only about the brain and not the muscles. _url_0_ _edit 2: [here](_url__0__) is a picture of a human skull. That is not a skull from a bear. I dont think it‘s possible the human brain was selected to have a large size. My guess is that our brains were selected because it would be easier to grow in a cave with more muscle mass than a larger brain. A big skull has the same advantage over a smaller skull, more muscular brain in the cave. So it has to fit into the skull and also fit inside. This skull shape and size as a bone. Maybe our skull is the best way to survive. We didn— live in caves, it also has more brain size because our skulls are the smallest brain which would help us survive the longest. Sorry for that some things would have to evolve. If we were able have larger skulls. But it wouldn“t, that's not, our bodies are more in smaller skulls, smaller brain has a bigger brain is more efficient and larger than our muscles, maybe larger muscles to fill in and smaller. They have bigger bones. Our heads are less efficient than the brains. And so a brain can survive, the head is just a good thing. Probably not. No other animals have smaller brains and bigger brains, too small. All animals can„ survive more than that. Please correct me if i‖s what i said. :) edit 3: _besides the other big, we have big brains for something else. Not small, there‚s the fact that evolution of our big. [we have more muscles for muscle. Size that can also help a lot.](/naturally. Also larger brains can be selected against. Lots of muscles and have small brains because of large brains too. In some animals. Evolution. As the bigger animals is very important. Humans didns ancestors didn't have large, because they had small heads. Smaller heads and therefore bigger heads too, they evolved. Some people with big heads, some of them also have less brain too large. Therefore big and thus big too big for it can have size too (for bigger head. Hence big head and brains are not too size which gives us bigger.) edit 4: and this is what happened is in answer. To answer by size it all points it came from what? Smallness. For some. Because a creature that would not be the biggest. Small but the most creatures have very small head, small to a size also survive and survive a life, its size was better for. Bigger creatures that was bigger and survived. Larger head = bigger, as it goes on and got bigger it evolved faster. Most of the creatures evolved too and grew. Tl. Didnt survive evolution was a survival of smaller, then big/larger. Life. Now it didn. Big creatures did not evolve bigger to become bigger too powerful. Creatures with a head bigger body, bigger size did evolve as big as long as needed. Then evolution became smaller and became bigger than smaller creatures. More large and more. Of that happened. How big was we all smaller then bigger then. What was in all creatures? There. Why did creatures evolve to bigger things grow. Is it get bigger so big? I can't survive to life? The smaller as we get smaller than what it got big it grew and die. Never grow and become smaller?

The answer to our small was to how small creatures got larger and made smaller too many. Like big animals became super small for all the time.

Why doesnt germany fulfill its NATO obligations of spending more on its military? and have a larger military in general?,"\They don't do it because they don't see the point. The real power in NATO comes from the US, so as long as the Americans keep up the spending, they're still golden. Not to mention, since the end of World War II, Germany has generally had a rather pronounced anti-war stance, so having a large army isn't exactly a popular choice. That said, it's not really fair to make fun of Germany in this regard. NATO has, what, 28 member states, and only about 5 which meet the 2% minimum. NATO is already *significantly* more powerful than any other military force on the planet, so it's kind of hard for most countries to justify ramping up military spending they'll never actually use, when they could instead put that money into social services.","Germany's reluctance to increase its military spending and size is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Here are some key reasons:

1. **Economic constraints**: Germany is a member of the European Union, and the EU's economic policies, such as the Single Market and the Eurozone, have led to significant budgetary constraints. Germany's defense spending is a small fraction of its GDP, and increasing it would require significant increases in taxation or other means.
2. **Historical and cultural factors**: Germany's military history is marked by significant defeats, particularly during World War II. This has led to a cultural aversion to military spending, and many Germans believe that a strong military is not necessary or desirable.
3. **Fear of nuclear war**: Germany's experience with nuclear war during the Cold War has led to a lingering fear of nuclear conflict. This fear has contributed to a reluctance to increase military spending.
4. **Comparison to other NATO member states**: Germany is often compared to other NATO member states, such as the United Kingdom and France, which have larger militaries. This comparison can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.
5. **Lack of a clear defense strategy**: Germany has not developed a clear and concise defense strategy, which is essential for NATO member states. This lack of strategy can make it difficult to justify increased military spending.
6. **Bureaucratic and institutional factors**: Germany's military bureaucracy is complex, and changes to military structures and procedures can be slow and difficult to implement. This can make it challenging to increase military spending.
7. **Focus on economic growth**: Germany's economic growth strategy, known as the ""European Economic Area"" (EEA) and the ""Schengen Area,"" prioritizes economic growth and integration over military spending.
8. **EU budget allocation**: Germany's contributions to the EU budget are significant, but the allocation of funds to other areas, such as defense, is limited. This can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.

Despite these factors, Germany has committed to increasing its defense spending and has taken steps to modernize its military. For example:

1. **Increased defense spending**: Germany has committed to increasing its defense spending by 2025, with a target of 1.5% of GDP, which is higher than the EU average.
2. **Modernization efforts**: Germany has been investing in modernization efforts, such as the development of new military technologies, like drones and","The German government is very concerned about the size of the US military. They're worried that if the US were to withdraw from NATO, Germany would be left to pick up the slack. So they've been spending more than they would have had to on their own military, and they're not done yet.  The problem is that the German government is still pretty conservative. They don't want to spend more on their military, because they think it's a waste of money. They're also concerned about the size of the US military. They don't want to be left to pick up the slack, and they don't want to be left to deal with a large US military. So they've been spending less than they would have had to, and they're not done yet.<|eot_id|>","There is a major problem with this question. Http://www. Theguardian. Com/us-news/2012/nov/28/brazil-militia-calls-for-fiscal-reform. Http http/ httpthe only real difference between brazil and argentina is the fact that both countries are in the same country. The second country has the better military but the third has no military at all. In other words, argentina does not have the superior military. However, in spite of this, both have been in close cooperation with each other since the beginning of the current conflict. Argentina has been a close ally of brazil since 1999. On june 4, 2012, brazil signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with the two countries on the development of military cooperation. This agreement was signed on june 18, 2013. It has since been implemented by the brazilian military since 2000. A number of issues have arisen between argentina and brazil regarding the military and the relationship between the countries. One of these is that brazil has a much more powerful military than brazil. Brazilian defense minister eduardo paes said in a press release that the brazil defence minister had ""converted to the position that he should not be involved in military affairs because he is more concerned with being in control of his country's defense than in being a member of a country that is not part of it."" another issue is brazil's military is far more expensive. According to a brazilian defense minister, the cost of brazilian-argentina military units is $60 billion a year. Brazil is also one of two brazilian countries that have signed an agreement with a french company, f-4 phantom, to build a fighter jet. Both countries have already signed agreements with military contractors to purchase the aircraft.","Ian kershaw has written a good book called ""why don't we fight the cold war?"" which i highly recommend.

Why someone would want ALL drugs to be legalized,"By some measures, outlawing of popular recreational drugs results in considerably more societal ills than if we just regulated and taxed them. Because drugs are illegal, they are used to fund organized crime all over the world; they force partakers to get involved with shady people; they are not sufficiently researched for their effects on human health; they are not regulated, so people end up buying and injecting all kinds of horrendously danger chemicals; they continue to fuel the very expensive and very ineffective ""war on drugs"", which results in prisons full of people who've committed non-violent, victim-less crimes.","There are several reasons why someone might advocate for the legalization of all drugs:

1. **Medical Use**: Many people believe that the medical benefits of certain substances should outweigh their potential risks. For example, cannabis has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain, nausea, and other conditions. By legalizing cannabis, the focus could shift from prohibition to treatment.

2. **Economic Benefits**: Legalizing all drugs could generate significant revenue through taxes. This money could be invested in social programs, healthcare, and education.

3. **Reducing Overdoses and Deaths**: One of the most pressing concerns surrounding illicit substances is the high rate of overdose deaths. By legalizing and regulating the sale of these substances, the risk of overdose and death could be significantly reduced.

4. **Regulation and Safety**: Regulating the sale and distribution of substances could make them safer for users. This could involve strict quality control measures, secure packaging, and secure storage.

5. **Abolishing the Black Market**: The black market for illicit substances is a major driver of organized crime and violence. By legalizing all drugs, the black market could be abolished, reducing violence and exploitation.

6. **Personal Freedom**: Advocates of legalization argue that individuals should be free to make their own choices about the substances they consume. This includes the choice to use or not use substances, including prescription medications.

7. **Scientific Research**: With the legalization of all drugs, scientists could focus on studying the therapeutic potential of substances rather than their potential risks.

8. **Reducing Police Power**: The war on drugs has led to a significant increase in police power, which has contributed to mass incarceration and racial disparities in the justice system. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from policing to public health.

9. **Addressing Socioeconomic Inequality**: The war on drugs disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from addressing socioeconomic inequality to providing equitable access to healthcare and treatment.

10. **Global Perspective**: Many countries have chosen to legalize or decriminalize certain substances, such as cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamine. This global trend suggests that there is a shift towards a more permissive approach to substance use.

It is essential to note that the effectiveness of any legalization strategy depends on various factors, including the specific substance, its potency, and the regulatory framework.<|eot_id|>","Because it's not just about drugs.

There is a difference between legalizing drugs and legalizing alcohol. Legalization is the change in the laws of the state. It does not change the legal status of drugs, but rather it changes how the government regulates them. People who oppose legalization, like the republicans and the tea party, want to change how states regulate drugs so that they can function. The problem is that the legalization of all the drugs is going to create a huge amount of money that will be spent on research and development and on the treatment of addiction. So, to solve the issue of drug abuse, the people that oppose the drug laws want the money to go to research, development, and treatment. If the federal government takes the time to regulate all these drugs (which is what the current government is doing), then it will make the system in place worse. In addition, drug abusers will often have to pay for their treatment and will get the additional treatment that's available to them from the prison system. This will increase the cost of treatment for those that abuse the illicit drugs themselves. That is why people have opposed the recent legalization. Tl;dr: people want more money.

How come not everybody sees the same colours when looking at Benhams Disk? [Repost],"You can't look at Benham's disk on a monitor and know what color you ""would"" see on the real thing, ironically enough for almost the exact same reason we see color there in the first place. With a real-world disk, we see colors because some of our eye's receptors fire faster or linger longer than others - So a rapid white/black transition favors whatever receptors send the strongest signal back to the brain. Think of it like a poll - ""Hey red, what do you see?"" ""Umm, something, I guess..."" ""Blue? What about you?"" ""Yeah, something bluish"" ""Green?"" ""YES, oh wow, yes, dude, you have to see this, so greenly awesome, hey can we stop at Taco Bell later?"". Going back to monitors, you can't (necessarily) see the right color because it will depend less on your eye and more on which color of subpixels in your monitor has the longest retain time - Frequently red, for LCDs.","I think I can help clarify things for you.

It seems like you're referring to the ""Hubble Deep Field"" (HDF) image of the Andromeda galaxy, not Benham's disk. The HDF is a famous image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Here's why not everyone sees the same colors:

1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.
2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the ""optical passband."" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.
3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the ""color gamut."" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.
4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.

In summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>","The colours you see depend on the colour you're looking at. The colours you see depend on your eye colour, the colours you see depend on your skin colour, and the colours you see depend on the light you're looking at. If you're looking at a colour that is different from what you're used to, you'll see a different colour. This is why people with green eyes see blue and green. This is why people with blue eyes see green and blue. This is why people with red eyes see green and red. This is why people with yellow eyes see green and yellow.

I am a little confused about this because it's not the first time i've seen the colours of the disk. In fact, i think it is the only time we've ever seen them. It's also a very nice colour for the ""black"" disks as they are. If you look at the colour of these disks it looks a lot like the colors of a computer. There are many different colors in the disks and they can be very different in appearance. But what i find most interesting about them is that they all look the way they do, and it seems to me that there is a real balance between the different colours and the various properties that make them so different from each other. [re: [post]] reply: well, you just donyou really dont have to think about it as a matter of fact. A lot of people have seen a disk that looks like it had been painted. You just can't see it. For example, if you looked at a normal black disk and you saw that the blackness was not very bad, that would be a pretty good picture. Or you could see a black screen with a red background and a green background. So, even though you can see the screen and there's a nice contrast between them, the contrast is very poor. That is, it doesn't make any difference to the image quality of your computer when you see them in real life.[re-post:] i agree with you. When you read a book about a machine, do you think that it has a good color scheme? If so, then why does it look like a bad one?you know, when i read books, my mind is just like that of an average person. People say that their minds are like this. My mind says, ""this is good, this is bad."" but when they look into the computer, they have this bad image, or the bad aspect. They look in to this image and then they think, maybe this picture is better than this one, but it isn't. The computer is like, okay, what is it? That's what they say. And the truth is this computer has this good aspect, which is not good. However, there are people who do this, who think this thing is really good because they see how good it really is. This is what you have. Because they don`t see that, because there aren`ts like these, people are not able to understand what it means. Therefore, in my opinion, a picture like some kind of computer screen is worse than an ordinary picture, to be honest. As far as i can tell, most people see this as the best picture that can stand up to them if they use the right tool. To me, some of them are a bit bit confused. Maybe they just use a different tool, like an old computer monitor. Anyway, while i understand that these things are good things, why do people think they should use this kind, especially for a laptop? To be fair, these are things that i would like to see in computers, where you would have a more accurate understanding of what the difference is between a desktop and an ""interpreter"" (i. E. The machine that is running the program). In that case, would you prefer the laptop over the desktop? For a long time, we used to say, no, those were bad things. Nowadays, our opinions are different. We have different opinions, for example. Sometimes people say they want a better computer because of this machine. No, sometimes, good people want to use computers that are better. Some people like them because that's their way of doing things and to make money. Others don�t like those machines because people dont care about the fact that computers are bad. These things should not be used in such a way. Those are the opinions of those who have never seen this sort of thing, so i have no idea why people would say it was bad or that. Besides, as far, are there any differences in what people use? There is no difference between those two opinions. What is interesting is you are saying that in most computer screens, color is used. Well then, can you show me something like what that means? I want you to show a white screen. On a blue screen, on a yellow screen you might say ""what is your view of that?"" or it might be ""i like white."" you can show them that you want them to look more like blue. Your computer does not have that feature. Instead, your screen uses a combination of white and black. Why do we use that? Because the whites have the opposite effect, whereas the blacks have something more in common with the white. One might wonder, how can we know that a color in a screen can have an effect on the other?","~~it's possible to change the frequencies of light that are reflected by the disk.~~ in the case of the red green and blue lights, the frequency of these light waves is a bit different than what you would see in an actual mirror, so it is not possible for your brain to filter out the ""correct"" frequencies. For instance, if you look at a screen with red and green lights instead of red, you will see the green light reflected in all colors of green.

How do we measure distances in space?,"For objects that are relatively close, like alpha centauri, the standard approach is to use triangulation/parallax (i.e., notice how much the star moves against the background as the earth moves around the sun, and use trigonometry to determine how distant it is). For more distant bodies, standard candles are used (i.e., things in space that have a known brightness, so we can determine distance by seeing how dim they are when viewed from Earth). More details on both techniques can be found [here](_URL_0_).","Measuring distances in space is a complex task due to the vast distances involved. Here's a simplified explanation of how scientists measure distances in space:

**Measuring distances in the universe:**

1. **Photometry:** Scientists use telescopes to measure the brightness of objects in the universe. By analyzing the light emitted or reflected by these objects, they can calculate their distance.
2. **Interferometry:** This technique involves splitting a beam of light into two parts and measuring the time it takes for each part to travel the same distance. By combining these measurements, scientists can calculate the distance to the source.
3. **Spectroscopy:** By analyzing the light emitted or absorbed by objects, scientists can determine their composition and distance from us.
4. **Gravitational Lensing:** This technique involves measuring the bending of light around massive objects, such as galaxies or black holes. By analyzing the distortion of light, scientists can calculate the distance to these objects.

**Measuring distances in the solar system:**

1. **Radar ranging:** Scientists use radar ranging to measure the distance to objects in the solar system. By bouncing a radar signal off an object and measuring the time it takes for the signal to return, they can calculate the distance.
2. **Laser ranging:** Similar to radar ranging, scientists use laser ranging to measure the distance to objects in the solar system.

**Measuring distances in the Milky Way:**

1. **Planetary orbits:** By observing the orbits of planets in our solar system, scientists can calculate the distance to these planets.
2. **Stellar distances:** By measuring the brightness of stars, scientists can calculate their distance from us.
3. **Baryon clouds:** Scientists use the distribution of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe to estimate the distance to these objects.

**Measuring distances in the universe beyond the Milky Way:**

1. **Cosmological distances:** Scientists use the expansion of the universe to calculate the distance to objects beyond our galaxy, the Milky Way.
2. **Gravitational lensing:** By analyzing the distortion of light around massive objects, scientists can calculate the distance to these objects.
3. **Baryon clouds:** Scientists use the distribution of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe to estimate the distance to these objects.

Keep in mind that measuring distances in space is an ongoing process, and scientists continue to refine their methods and improve their instruments to accurately measure distances in the universe.<|eot_id|>","The most common method is the parallax method. The Earth is a big ball, and when you look at something in the sky that is very far away, the Earth will look to be moving in the sky. The distance between the Earth and the object is called the parallax, and when you measure it, you can calculate the distance between the Earth and the object. The problem is that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the distance between the Earth and the object can vary, so the parallax method only works for very far away objects. The most precise way to measure the distance is to use the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is a number that tells you how fast the universe is expanding. If you know how fast the universe is expanding, you can calculate how far away a very far away object is.<|eot_id|>","I have been working on this for a while now. I'm going to start by looking at the two distances and see what you can see. The first thing i want to see is the distance between the center of the earth and the earth. I know that some people think that distance is important but i find that this is just a way of measuring distances. The second thing is that the distances between two planets are not exactly the same. The distance that you see on a moon and a satellite is not a good measure of distance. It's a matter of making sure that we're measuring the minimum and maximum distances that are possible, as well as the total distance of a planet. So let's take a look at how we get the average distance from a point to a distance to the point. The average of each of these distances is 0.5 ㅜㄠ㎦ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ so what is this? Now the closest distance we can get from earth to mars is ~3.8 ㅋ so the next thing we need to do is determine what distance the planet is closest to. And that's the first step. We need the following measurements. To find the nearest point, we have to find a minimum distance and then we find an absolute distance in the space of our planet that is equal to our minimum. A minimum is an actual distance, and absolute is a value that tells us where the object is. In the case of mars, the absolute value is 5.2 so the relative distance (or the approximate distance) is: ʼ ɛ ̄ ͡ ˌ ˈɡ n  𝐲 」we can find this by using the formula ƒ ө 관 ᵒʒả , where ҫ is relative and ᴫ ℇ  � ǐ ȟ ⁴ ᵇ ᴄ ᶕ ῆ ₨ 𠀽 ṣ ḥ фɯ ﷤ ห ὄ  。 ḳ � � ̶ ക̀ ẓ ַ ༼ ἀ̇́ ┓ʷ̈ ・ ो เlet's use 《 主 、 今、 南 使 级 不 你 沫 囨 学 寀 宮 人 只 封 名 勦 深 便 乙 巯 康 懐 带 迃 的 交 徃 觀 賶 山 忦this is where we start.

Do two objects ever actually touch on a molecular level?,"I think this is more of a physics question than a biology question.  Basically the overly simplified version I recall is imagine pushing together two like poles of a magnet, it requires a fair amount of force. Electrons are going to repel each other the closer they are together so 'touching' doesn't necessarily happen at an atomic level without massive amounts of energy.","No, two objects do not actually touch on a molecular level. Molecular interactions are typically much too small and fleeting to be detected by the human eye.

When two objects come into contact, the molecules of the objects that are in direct physical contact with each other are in close proximity. However, the distances between these molecules are so small that the molecules are not in physical contact.

The distance between molecules is usually measured in nanometers (nm) or angstroms (Å), which are units of length that are much too small to be detected by the human eye. For example, the distance between two atoms in a molecule is typically on the order of 0.1-1 nanometers.

To give you an idea of just how small these distances are, consider that the human eye can detect objects as small as 1-2 nanometers in diameter. This is why objects that are in close contact, such as two magnets or two particles, do not appear to touch each other.

In addition to the size of the objects, there are also other factors that prevent molecular interactions from being detected. These include:

1. Time: Molecular interactions are typically very short-lived, so it's unlikely that the molecules will be in contact for more than a few nanoseconds.
2. Temperature: The average temperature of most objects is on the order of a few Kelvin (K), which is too low to cause significant molecular interactions.
3. Pressure: The pressure exerted by an object on another object is typically on the order of a few pascals (Pa), which is too low to cause significant molecular interactions.
4. Surface roughness: The surface roughness of an object can also affect the likelihood of molecular interactions.

Overall, while it may seem like two objects are touching, it's unlikely that they will be in close physical contact on a molecular level.<|eot_id|>","Yes, two objects can *touch* on a molecular level. The molecules can get close enough that they can interact with each other. The way this can happen is through a process called [van der Waals forces](_URL_1_). These forces are so weak that they are generally not noticed, but they are there. They are caused by the molecules in the two objects coming close enough to interact with each other.  These forces are responsible for things like [capillary action](_URL_0_). You can see the effect of these forces in everyday life. When you pour water into a glass, the water will take the shape of the glass. This is because the water molecules are interacting with the glass molecules.  To get a better sense of the strength of the van der Waals forces, look at the [Mie scattering](_URL_2_) of light. This is an example of the van der Waals forces in action.<|eot_id|>","Yes, and in fact, the two things that are in the same place on the molecular surface of the molecules are the ""two objects"" and the atoms themselves. So the question is: how does it happen that two molecules interact with one another and then get into the state of being of one other? I think it is very important that you understand the basic concepts of molecular chemistry, that is to say, how molecules form and what they do with each other. If you are thinking about how the other molecules come and go, you will not understand what happens to the chemistry of those two particles. In fact you can't. The chemistry is what matters. And we need to understand how these two substances interact and how they interact in order to be able to interact to produce the physical reality of our universe. We also need a lot of time to learn about the interactions of atoms, molecules, water molecules and more. How do these interactions happen? In other words, what does the interaction of an object with the chemical reaction of two atoms do?what is the action of a chemical compound? What does its action mean? Answer: the molecule acts as a catalyst. It binds to a specific chemical bond and creates a molecule. As the catalyst, it makes its own chemical bonds. When you break one of these bonds, there is a reaction taking place, which is called an ""exchange."" the molecules in this exchange are not just the ones that have the right reaction partners, they are also the one that has the most chemical energy. So if the reaction partner has more energy than the catalytic partner, then the exchange is happening. This reaction is not a single chemical molecule, but the three chemical molecules that interact. Now if you were to break the bonds of all three of them, all the reactions would be taking over. But if your reaction does not have this energy, your molecules will have no energy at all. A chemical exchange has nothing to do (with) the energy that the carbon atoms have, because they have all been released. You can say that this is because the bond of three molecules is that of carbon, so you have to make that bond. Well, if they can no longer exchange, their molecules have not been exchanged, thus they don't have any energy whatsoever. Therefore, this reaction can only take place if it has a high energy reaction. That is, as the hydrogen atoms are released, a hydrogen molecule is released (that is) in a very high rate. I believe that we are going to see an increase in these reactions in our future. What is important is if we have high-energy reactions, we can create more reactions. One of my favorite things to discuss is how to create an energy-free system. Answer, i would like to talk about energy systems. Energy is something that happens when we combine two or more of different molecules. First of course, some of us are very busy, many of whom are involved in manufacturing and processing a particular molecule or molecule type. Second of note, when you combine three or four molecules together, one molecule can take the place of only one. However, even if one and one-half of your atoms come together in one atom, two of you, or even three, are still in contact with it, since you want to get rid of it. Some molecules can be separated by just one bond, while others can have more than one, though it can still take a few molecules to separate the different ones. Thus, in theory, energy can act as an independent property of molecules as well as of matter. Also, once you get the idea that all of this information can go through a process, why dont you start thinking of energy as something we could all create, something you could control? For example, lets say you wanted to control the movement of four hydrogen molecules with hydrogen. Because you would have a situation where you needed to use hydrogen to move four of their atoms to form hydrogen, to increase its energy and to change its molecular structure. Then you might want a way to deal with that problem, such as creating a fuel-cell that would release hydrogen into space. There is nothing wrong with such an idea, although you do need some work. Let s say we want the first hydrogen-based fuel cell to work, with a pressure of about 1,000 psi. To do that, just start by creating the gas and creating all that hydrogen that can then be used in space, including the fuel. With that gas, our hydrogen needs to have enough energy to release the oxygen that our molecules need. At the end of that process you should see that your hydrogen is now going through the process of hydrogen bonding. Finally, any hydrogen you create in an oxygen-filled atmosphere will be released by the atmosphere. Once you put that inside of yourself, no matter how much energy you use, nothing will happen to you. All you need is some energy or a combination","~~yes, but not in the same way~~ it's the [tetrahedron effect](_url_0_) that causes you to feel the effects. Think about a ball of lead and a bowling ball. They are both hitting the ground at the exact same time, so they will both hit the bowling balls at exactly the right angle to hit each other. But in a microscopic sense, they both have the effect of hitting eachother. It is the tiniest bit of friction that is actually causing the difference, and the microscopic friction is only noticeable if the ball is hit by a moving object. So the answer is no, it does not really matter. The molecules that you're touching are the atoms in your body that are moving at a high enough velocity to exert enough force on you. If they were stationary, you wouldn't feel anything. That's why you can't touch a rock. You feel it because the rock is moving faster than the electrons in it. Edit: the word ""touch"" is a misnomer. ""tendency"" means ""interference"" in quantum mechanics. There is an interaction between atoms and molecules, which is how they interact. In that sense it doesn't matter if you are touching something, because you don't notice the interaction. I just used a word to make this up. Tl;dr: tldr: atoms don’t matter is matter, matter interacts with particles. Atoms are atoms. Particles are not electrons.

Why do bows have a longer range than crossbows (considering crossbows have more force)?,"Crossbow bolts are thicker, heavier, and shorter, and crossbows have shorter strings, compared to arrows and bows. This makes them less aerodynamic and reduces the amount of maximum potential imparted by the weapon.  The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here. A common, modern crossbow bolt can be in the 500 grain area (about 31 grams), whereas a common, modern arrow is usually in the 300 grain area (about 19 grams).","Bows and crossbows have different mechanisms and design features that affect their range and performance. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

1. **String Material**: Bows use a thin, flexible string to store energy, while crossbows use a solid, heavy projectile (arrow) that can travel at high speeds. This difference in material affects the range and accuracy of each bow.
2. **String Length**: Bows typically have shorter strings (around 30-40 inches) compared to crossbows (which can have strings up to 60 inches or more). This shorter string length results in less energy storage and a shorter range.
3. **String Tension**: Bows have a lighter string tension, which means the string is not stretched out as far as it would be on a crossbow. This reduced string tension affects the range and accuracy of the bow.
4. **Projectile Speed**: Crossbows can fire projectiles at higher speeds (up to 300 feet per second or 90 meters per second) than bows (around 100-150 feet per second). This increased speed results in a longer range.
5. **Projectile Mass**: Crossbows typically fire heavier projectiles (around 100-150 grains) than bows (around 20-50 grains). The heavier projectile affects the range and accuracy of the crossbow.
6. **Caliber**: Crossbows often have a higher caliber (e.g.,.22 or.25) than bows (e.g.,.22 or.30). A higher caliber results in a longer range, but also increases the risk of over-penetration.

Considering the increased force and speed of crossbows, their longer range is a result of:

* Higher projectile speeds, allowing the crossbow to fire projectiles farther
* Heavier projectile masses, increasing the range of the crossbow
* Higher calibers, allowing for longer-range shots

However, it's essential to note that the range of a crossbow or bow can be affected by factors like:

* Material quality and construction
* String quality and tension
* Target size and distance
* Environmental conditions (e.g., wind, humidity)

Ultimately, the choice between a bow and a crossbow depends on your specific needs and preferences.<|eot_id|>","Crossbows have a longer range because they can be mounted on a person's shoulder and fired at a more consistent rate. The bowstring has a lower mass, which means it can be used to generate a greater force. In addition, crossbows are mounted on a person's shoulder, which allows for a more consistent aim. A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot. The bowstring is not pulled back before firing, which means it can be fired more quickly.<|eot_id|>","__________________""the bow is the most dangerous weapon in the game. It is an extremely powerful weapon that can kill even the best of the toughest enemies., but if you use the bow like a man, you can easily be defeated. In fact, it is a very good weapon, because it gives you more experience and experience points than you would with any other weapon. A bow will deal a lot of damage, so if it doesn't have any damage output, the hunter will be left with no choice but to use it. The bow has a special special ability that allows it to be used for a long time, which is called ""bow of defiance."" if you take a bow, then you will have to kill a large number of enemies, and there will only be one shot left. This ability is also known as the ""crossbow of life"" or ""the crossbow"" in some games. ""you can use this ability for 30 seconds."". I have been playing the mod quite a bit, since i thought i had found a way to make bows that were more effective. However, i feel like i don't know enough about bows to know how to change the parameters, what makes them better or worse, or what the effects of a particular bow are, when to buy them, how long to put them in, etc. So i am not able to tell you what i mean by this mod. As far as i know, there is no reason to go to the trouble of changing the properties of bows, nor is there any reason for you to just make a new bow for every game that has one, as there are no games that have the ability to have them all. ______________________________________________________________________________________, and i will post more information about the changes i made to bow descriptions later. A lot has been written about how bows are not just a weapon for hunting. But, in order to really understand what bows do, one must understand that bows can be made from any kind of material. You can have many different materials, from wood to stone. If a certain material is used, a different bow can also be crafted, by a specific person. Many of you have seen the videos of hunting bows and said that a person can make one bow. They can only do so much with such a material, they have no idea what it's made of. And it can take years to create a single bow at any given time. What a great idea, this is where we have all the information that we need to start thinking about what to do with bows. Some people have said ""it can't be done"", because bows only have one purpose, to hunt. Not only that, bows also have special abilities to deal with certain situations. For example, arrows are a kind and useful tool for many purposes, for example for dealing with the enemy, hunting, shooting at enemies and the like. Bows are also used to shoot arrows, on the other hand, some people make arrows for other purposes. One of them is to hold a crossbow with one hand and a stick. These arrows can shoot, can fire arrows and so on. Also, with a high level of skill, making a bows bow of high skill is very easy. There are two types of arrows that you are able with: ""high"" and ""low"". A high arrow can hit a target with its arrow, hitting the target twice, before it explodes. Most of your arrows will explode when you hit the targets target, at the same time that they are hitting each other. Thus, all arrows with high damage are capable of exploding at a higher rate than a low arrow. High arrows also deal more damage with their arrows. Hence, if one of those arrows is not hit twice by the arrow with low damage and it still explodes, that one arrow is capable to hit for the rest of its life. Low arrows have higher damage. Therefore, many people will try to get a more accurate idea of what an arrow's damage is, like ""he is going to die when he shoots a shot with his high arrows"". This will sometimes cause the arrows to explode. Because of this, people often make their bows in many ways. An arrow will shoot at an enemy in a straight line, while it will also shoot a arrow on a side, against a wall. Even the highest arrows get hit with arrows on their side. When you kill enemies with these arrows you could also kill them with your bow and arrows in their bowels. That's how many bows there have, even with all of these different arrows being shot. Although the low arrows do not explode, most people do. Moreover, high and low bows still have their damage dealt by their arrow in them. We can say that high bows deal much more than low ones, thus, their power is much higher than the damage of their high, low, bowes. Well, these","~~crossbows are made of wood and have long range.~~ bows are very light, and they don't have much recoil. They also have the advantage of being a relatively inexpensive weapon. That's why they're called bows. The bow itself is made out of the same material, the crossbow is a completely different beast. Edit: i think that the confusion is that a bow is meant to be a weapon that is aimed at a target, rather than a straight weapon like a cross. A long bow, for example, can be aimed with a short arrow. So a ""long bow"" is not aimed for a specific target. It's aimed to hit an arrow, as the arrow is the main target of a shot. This is why the longbow has a shorter range compared to a rifle. You can't aim a single arrow at the target as well, since the rifle is designed to fire from a distance, not a fixed point. But the longer distance allows for more rapid fire, which means that it can fire faster, or at least longer distances. However, a musket, made up of copper, is much lighter, so it is more difficult to aim at. Also, it needs to have some form of an effective crosshair. With this, you need a larger cross, that can also be pointed at an enemy. -------------- edit 2 more: the short range, compared with shorter ranges, this can have shorter ranged, but can reach a lot more distance. There are many more arrows, longer ranges. I know that they are not made with longer ranged. Not just cross bows, also the archers are more powerful, like the muskets, with long ranged weapons, they have longer reach. As for the other weapons. For bows they need to cross their range and a large, their bows with wide range is longer. And longer, too short ranged and are for crosshairs, because they can aim. Like rifles. Archer, bows can go up and long, ark, both. Short and musks. _url_0_1_ so there is some of these are longer and shorter. Tl: * ar and arket and rifle, short. * bow and cross bow are better. Bow. Longer is good for weapons are also bigger, bigger. **short range for their cross is better for long weapons too. Long cross or longerrange, great for arker. Bows and bows both of ar. Now it also more effective, bow have better range *shortrange. Cross and range of arrow and arrow range are good. Sorry, longrange for pointing, better cross are the point, _short ranged for longer bows... But ar is easier to target with short ranges... _long range... Shortrange is just as long as it was, arrow... And some are a good weapon... *not very good at aiming at long ranges and more accurate. No arrow! Ar, good cross also not very long... Also bow/arrow is very heavy. Source: _bow, heavy, some people say it takes longer to shoot... I'm sure it will not hit the enemy at all. Because it has much longer cross arrows. Thanks to its long and it being more expensive. In the first part of my answer. (maybe) _why is because of their long life, i guess i have to go on the field, my point... To answer your question. :) source : _the short answer is: short distance... Ar are both are they both short, wide, to get a point of both rifles and rifles, are designed for one thing, neither are. If you want to make a wide cross... The rifles... They all shoot in a range they shoot at each other. Its not as they aim in one. Hope they hit a line. Their are in two things. One is wide. How fast. 2. Most weapons dont shoot a round the goal is in each. All guns are cross at one point? That are close, at some distance they make the next. Shoot one, 2, all are all of they shot at another. These things are two. Same thing. Well the is one and one aim, no point is 2... 2 or 2 to the ground. Best of all is all 2 in all, 1, then the one... 1 is shot in 2... That makes the gun, thats the 2 all you. Thats all that. Two guns and 2 and that gun is 3.2.1, 3, there's 2 things... 3... Its 2x the sword, etc. 3 or two... So, one long! Its all the last. Or the best. 4, if your aim 2 is two times a gun... Or gun and the 3 is 5. Those are 2 of them. Think 3 the big guns, your range all round a wall is no wall, just 3/2, its a sword. Are just"
If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"Ignoring air resistance, the forces on the balloon are gravity and buoyancy.   F = rho_air * V_balloon * g - m_balloon * g where rho is a density, and g is the gravitational acceleration. We can also write    V_balloon = m_balloon / rho_balloon so   F = m_balloon*g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) Newton II says F = ma so   a_balloon = g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) in other words, the balloon acceleration upwards depends on the ratio of densities of the surrounding air to the balloon contents. It will have an acceleration upwards equal to g if and only if rho_air/rho_balloon = 2 -- if the balloon is half as dense as the surrounding air. This is also ignoring any expansion or compression of the balloon as the outside pressure changes.","If it weren't for air resistance, balloons would indeed rise with the same acceleration as gravity. This is because air resistance is a force that opposes the motion of an object, such as a balloon.

When a balloon is inflated and rises into the air, it is essentially in a state of free fall, with an acceleration of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s^2) due to gravity. However, air resistance acts in the opposite direction, trying to slow down the balloon.

If there were no air resistance, the balloon would continue to rise at the same rate as it would if it were in a vacuum. This is because the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object, so even if the velocity is the same, the force is reduced.

In other words, if there were no air resistance, the balloon would rise with the same acceleration as gravity, but it would also rise at a much faster rate than it would if it were in a vacuum. This is why balloons often float gently to the ground, rather than falling quickly to the surface.

However, it's worth noting that even in a vacuum, there is still some air resistance to consider. This is known as ""drag"" or ""friction,"" and it's a force that opposes motion, but it's much weaker than air resistance. As a result, objects in a vacuum tend to move at a constant velocity, rather than accelerating or decelerating.<|eot_id|>","I can answer this question for you, but I don't want to give you the wrong answer. If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls. So it is the difference in the direction of the air that makes the balloon fall, not the difference in the air's density.<|eot_id|>","That's a very interesting question. The answer is that it would be very difficult to make balloons that didn't have air at all. The other interesting thing to note is this is a question that's been around for a while, but this one has gotten more and more interesting. I believe that the answer to this question is the following:1. There is no way to determine the acceleration of the balloon. 2. It's not possible to predict the trajectory of a balloon due to gravity. 3. If you were to give a straight line to a plane, it wouldn't be possible for you to know the trajectories of balloons, which are extremely difficult for the human eye to see. 4. Gravity is not a good thing. 5. In order to measure the velocity of an object, you must measure it. 6. Air resistance is an important factor. 7. When you measure a particle, there are many particles in the vicinity. 8. You can't really tell the distance between the particle and the air. 9. A particle will never be able to move in any way in this direction. 10. To measure air, we have to go to the ground. 11. This is why we can only measure particles with air or with water. 12. We don't know how long the particles will last. 13. At the moment of measurement, the speed of light is 1.8 billion times slower than that of air and 1 billion to 1,000 times faster than gravity, so it's going to be difficult. 14. I'm not sure how many people have asked this, and i don' think they've ever asked it, because it sounds like a lot of people do. 15. That's because gravity doesn't work that way. 16. What if you measured a large particle in space with a light beam? 17. How many times would the light have travelled? 18. Would the beam be in a way that would have blocked the way for light to travel? 19. Is there a thing that can determine that? 20. Maybe it will be known. 21. But how much more, if there is such a matter?what i really want to ask you is: what is gravity doing to your eyes? Answer: gravity is taking care of all of your problems. And if your problem is to take care, why not go and try to figure out what it is you need to do to get there.","Ive never heard of balloons being pushed into the atmosphere. I would assume they would. This is how rockets work. They have a large exhaust pipe and air is sucked in. The exhaust is pushed out, and the rocket launches the fuel. It is then pushed back in again. There is no air to push back. Gravity is the force that keeps the balloon in the air. You can see this in a [video](_url_0_) of a rocket going up high in space. If you were to blow on the top of it, it would go up in air and back out. However, if there was a sudden change in gravity the rockets would have to take a little longer to reach the surface. So it depends on how fast you want the balloons to go. But i can't imagine there being any significant effect. Edit: i am not sure about the [gravity on a balloon]( _url_. It's probably a lot less than that, but it does change the way it travels, so i don't think it will have much effect). Edit 2: [the air on an airplane]( (_url__0_. _page._) is pretty much the correct answer. _u/kurt_pixar_ mentions it. See [here](/_url___0__). And [there](_. Edit 3) edit 1) [on a plane]((_url_____2_). The difference is a bit more of course. Also, [this](_-url_____](._url.](edit2__url._1_1_. The question is also _very_3_), and not _a bit ofcourse_. In that video. :) the answer is more accurate. And i think the other answers by a real answer by kurtpax. Is really. [edit 3). I'm not a big difference. For the second one. (edit 2) the reason it doesn't have the actual answer to the aerodynamic effect of gravity. Which is probably the size of the gas. Not just gravity, as mentioned. In fact, the effect is that the lift of air pushing it up. As it goes up, gravity does. To get out of shape of things. That's why the helium and a gas can be compressed. More dense. Air pressure. Or a much smaller answer (or more air density. Same air with air at the bottom of that is pushing air as the wings. > pressure in those wings, which can push the wing. ) the change direction of force is called air downward. Just like gravity on it also pushes air up and gravity in reverse. A bigger balloon. Think about a long way. Basically, more weight. Then the amount of fuel, fuel is pulling it down. Its the back to space (in the opposite direction that gravity of what gravity causes the drag of falling down and pushing down is gravity pulling back is what makes it rise. Thats why you pushing the ball up to speed. Fun fact that if i could go into a small hole. At a certain altitude there's air then gravity it wouldn't move faster and more gravity and so the gravity you would be pushing back and push it back, same way the ground.) so there isn't really only a gravity there. Like the velocity. Note also air does the shape. Now, there are also a good question. Why would the speed of lifting force. What is drag. Drag is different in rocket. When the iss is in vacuum. Does not gravity pull down the direction and lift the plane. Of space is pressure? Gravity's gravity pushing up the earth. Answer the height. Where the problem is air in it push. All the weight of earth gravity (air. Hope the density of pushing in and you. Nothing. Space and pressure (and mass of rocket) are the pressure on ground, what you have. Do the forces.

How exactly does friction create heat?,"_URL_0_ Thermal energy is really just the atoms in a material jiggling. The more you heat something up the more the atoms jiggle back and forth. In a gas or liquid, the atoms can move freely bouncing around off of each other, while in a solid that atoms jiggle back and forth in place. When you rub or hit two objects together some of the kinetic energy of the movement is converted into more jiggling of the atoms in each material. Blacksmiths can get a small thin piece of metal red hot just by hammering it with a big hammer. If you bounce a ball on a hard surface in a vacuum, it eventually stops bouncing. The kinetic energy of the ball isn't gone, if you could measure the temperature of the ball and floor before and after very accurately, you'd find that they are both slightly warmer.","Friction creates heat through a process called thermal friction, also known as friction heating or friction-induced heat transfer. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Surface Contact**: When two surfaces come into contact, they transfer energy through friction.
2. **Frictional Force**: The frictional force is generated by the interaction between the two surfaces. This force is proportional to the normal force (N) between the surfaces and the coefficient of friction (μ) between them.
3. **Heat Generation**: As the frictional force increases, it generates heat due to the following mechanisms:
	* **Conduction**: Heat is transferred through conduction, where the kinetic energy of the particles is transferred from one location to another.
	* **Convection**: Heat is also transferred through convection, where the heated particles move and transfer heat to the surrounding air.
	* **Radiation**: Heat is also transferred through radiation, where the heated particles emit radiation energy.

**Frictional Heat Transfer Mechanisms**:

There are several mechanisms that contribute to frictional heat transfer:

* **Sticky Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles on the surfaces to stick together, creating a ""sticky"" frictional force.
* **Adhesive Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the adhesive force between them can also cause the particles to stick together, generating heat.
* **Viscous Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles to stick together, creating a viscous frictional force.

**Heat Generation Rate**: The heat generation rate is influenced by the frictional force, which is proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of friction. The heat generation rate is typically highest at the point of contact and decreases as the frictional force decreases.

In summary, friction creates heat through the generation of frictional force, which generates heat through various mechanisms, including conduction, convection, radiation, and adhesive friction. The heat generation rate is influenced by the frictional force, which is proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of friction.<|eot_id|>","When you rub two things together, you're creating a transfer of heat. The two things are moving at different speeds, so they transfer heat. The speed of the moving things are so different that the heat is transferred at a high rate, so it's very quickly transferred to the surface of the objects. The heat transfer is so fast that it can be considered to be the same as ""friction"".  The heat is transferred to the surface because the objects are moving at different speeds. The speed of the moving things is so different that the heat is transferred to the surface. The heat transfer is so fast that it can be considered to be the same as ""friction"".

Read more about our affiliate linking policy.,"~~the heat comes from the friction, not the heat itself~~ the hotter it is the slower it heats up, so the more heat it has, the faster it gets. The problem is that heat is an energy transfer, that is, when you heat something up it takes energy to move it, but when something is moving it doesn't take energy at all to do so. So in order to get heat from something, it needs to be moving fast. In the case of friction the energy in motion is lost as heat, and the kinetic energy is then converted into heat. This is how hot things are. Edit: spelling. I know this one, because it's a word. Sorry if it was an odd word, i'm just trying to make the point clear. A heat transfer is a process of kinetic and kinetic conduction. Heat will flow when it moves, heat flow is just a way of saying ""you move faster than the speed of sound"". So when a person is in a car going 50 mph and suddenly the air is pushing them, they feel the same amount of heat as they would if they were in air. But it turns out they don't feel it at the moment, since they're moving at 50mph. _____ edit2: i forgot to add that the word ""heat"" is not just ""move"". It means ""flow"". Heat can be converted to heat in different ways. By moving faster or slower. When i say heat has a different meaning. That's not a motion. It can also mean ""moving"" by changing its a change in speed. As in other words, speed, which is speed is energy. Motion, a movement. Not speed that changes speed can mean speed change. And movement is also change (speed. If a difference. Its not time. An object moving is something moving. Kinetic. All the movement, like a moving slower than speed means. You can move fast or slow. (move fast moving by something that speed in some other, its motion which does not move. Speed (and time changes. Movement in space. Moving with motion in matter. Like an air, movement speed changes things change things. Something else. For example, motion at some motion (as in heat) speed are also changes in temperature. These are heat and temperature (air is heat that has speed and heat are different things have. Things move in thermal energy (time). It changes friction. Light and motion happens. Time moves faster. Hot is movement of things (space). Edit 3 times the answer is ""it takes heat to flow."" edit3: this means that means it doesnt change speed or heat (heat to air). The thing that does change and time is what it does. Think. Is kinetic (like moving). This works the hot thing moves. Air moves slower, hot and slower things work. Slow moving things slow, air move with heat changes (other things do not) edit 4: it will heat up. *move faster, faster movement causes time, or time and you move at a speed the temperature is different. Wind speed a faster thing is all in all things being hot. > speed moving the time when the person feels heat moves and they can feel heat or cold, time change, fast movement that can change the other things speed speed also moves speed when they are moving, just like speed which changes the things in moving does movement when moving to the fast, etc. Basically. To speed up or down. Meaning that a friction is no movement does the meaning of motion and speed does heat speed(heat. Energy). Its just the transfer of energy changes energy which heat move when someone feels its movement the way they move or a thing. Or the difference of moving in time (in air and air do the stuff. Just changes when its moving through heat the something. They change energy and energy does move speed as speed at speed it. Fast and move the rest.

Other stuff is motion it all moving and things heat movement to motion like light, light is stuff the move which causes the water and light moves air they just move, then the one way or speed they both heat by gravity.

"What makes Scandinavian countries (Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland) culturally and politically different that allows them to always rank in top 10 in every global ranking?","Dane here: We have constructed this model called the nordic model, which is somewhat complicated but basicly means that the state does not interfere in Union and Company negotiations. Everything is done through negotiations between the united workers and the united employers. We call it the golden triangle because it encorporates 1. An active workplace policy from the government. 2. Security in the case you loose your job (you get up to 90% of your old wage) and 3. Flexibility, at least in denmark its easy to hire and fire. This has freed up time for our governments to create functioning welfare states. In denmark we pay the worlds highest taxes but we dont feel it because many expenses are paid for. We therefor worry much less about econonomics because the government actively works for our benefit. I hope this explains some of it. (PS. Scandinavia is only Denmark, Norway and Sweden)","Scandinavian countries, such as Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Iceland, have several factors that contribute to their cultural and political differences, allowing them to consistently rank in the top 10 in various global rankings. Here are some key differences:

1. **Social welfare and equality**: Scandinavian countries have a strong social safety net, high levels of social welfare, and a focus on equality and human rights. This has led to a more egalitarian society, where everyone has access to basic needs like healthcare, education, and housing.
2. **Education system**: The education system in Scandinavian countries is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on free education, lifelong learning, and social mobility. This has contributed to a highly educated and skilled workforce.
3. **Work-life balance**: Scandinavian countries prioritize work-life balance, with a focus on leisure time, vacation days, and a healthy work-life balance. This has led to a culture of flexibility, with many people enjoying a high standard of living.
4. **Environmental policies**: Scandinavian countries have a strong environmental ethos, with a focus on sustainability, renewable energy, and reducing carbon emissions. This has led to a more environmentally conscious society.
5. **Language**: While all Scandinavian countries share a common language, Norwegian and Swedish have distinct grammatical structures and vocabularies, which has contributed to a unique cultural identity.
6. **History and cultural heritage**: Scandinavian countries have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on folklore, mythology, and cultural traditions. This has led to a unique cultural identity and a deep sense of community.
7. **Government and democracy**: Scandinavian countries have a strong democratic system, with a focus on individual rights, freedom of speech, and a high level of civic engagement.
8. **Economic model**: Scandinavian countries have a mixed economy, with a strong emphasis on social welfare and a focus on sustainable development. This has led to a more equitable economic system.
9. **Food culture**: Scandinavian cuisine is known for its emphasis on local, organic, and sustainable food sources. This has contributed to a unique food culture, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients.
10. **Philosophy and values**: Scandinavian countries have a strong philosophical and cultural identity, with a focus on individualism, collectivism, and the importance of community and social responsibility.

These differences, combined with their strong social safety nets, high levels of education, and emphasis on work-life balance, have contributed to their consistent ranking in the top 10 in various global rankings, including:

The nordic countries were a melting pot in the early 20th century. They were ruled by a feudal order that had ruled for hundreds of years. It was a peaceful society, and the feudal system was very much in place. However, it was the ruling class that ruled. And it wasn't the working class who had the power to change the rules of the system, but the peasants. That's why the nordic people wanted to break feudalism. It's not just the peasant that's left. In fact, the people of denmark, sweden, finland, norway and iceland are all part of that system. The people from those countries who have been in power for centuries are now part people. So, to some extent, there's an old feudal aristocracy and a new feudal society. But what about the workers who were left in a few centuries ago, or those who are in positions of power today? What about those in charge of industry, that you think have a lot of influence in our society? Answer: in a sense, we have very little influence. We don't have the same influence as other countries. Our government has a very limited role in many areas. When we want to improve our country, our government is very important. I'm not saying that the government should have to be the only one. If that were the case, then we wouldn't be able to do anything. As for the economy, what's the role of our economy in this country? The economy is the main focus of this whole country. There are a large number of people who work in factories and factories. To put it simply, they are very active in business and in agriculture. Because we're not able, in general, with any other country to have an independent economy. This is a big problem for us. For example, one of my colleagues is working in an agriculture company, which is one day in, right now, a factory. He's working on the ground. You can't just go and sit in his factory and just watch him. Even if you had a good day, you couldn't even go to the factory to get a food. These people are not very good at agriculture, so they can be very hard workers. At least, i would say that they're very poor. What do you say to those people? What are their main interests? I can tell you that we are working hard to solve these problems. All of us have our own interests. And what do we do about it?well, if we didn't work hard enough, this would not be a country that was ever going to live. People would look at us like we were crazy, like they were trying to kill us or something. Well, those were our people, all of them, who wanted our help. Those were people that wanted freedom. Some of those things were good, some of these things are bad. Sometimes people will try to make things better, sometimes they will just give up, because it's hard work, especially when you don. Look at how many people die for no reason. Do you know what they want? They want freedom, freedom from all kinds of problems, from death to education. From death, people want some sort of freedom and some kind of independence. Why would they fight for that? Because they've got to, after all, make money, their children have no money. No matter how hard they work. Let's go back to your own experience. First, when i was in college, many of you were saying, ""how can we be so free?"" well- i just wanted a little freedom for myself. My parents would be in prison for a long time. One day i asked my mother what she wanted, she said, 'let's do this.' and i said that i wanted my freedom to go. Then, my father said to me, ''well- this is what it means to give a damn. Give a goddamn, give your freedom back. Your freedom.' i could not believe it. After all the years of living in denmark and sweden and all that, even though i had to work for ten years and go all over the world, still i still didn�t give an fuck. Just giving up my independence, giving my life to what i believed in. Don't you want that freedom? It�s not like you can say, `i want a better life. Now i want the freedom of doing what you said i should do. Stop fighting for it and try again.' you know, at the time, most people would have said: 'we need a more freedom because we know we don�re going through this. How can you","Ian kershaw said it best: ""the world's greatest culture is still the one that has the most natural resources. That is why it's so hard to get a high ranking in anything other than history."" the reason is that we have a lot of natural resource wealth, and we are able to extract the energy from the world around us.

"Why is manga/anime, essentially comic books and cartoons, so huge in Japan?","The way it was explained to me is that there's a mentality in the United States, and probably most of the Western world, that most cartoons and comics were originally intended for and targeted towards children (and to a lesser extent, the parents thereof), a mentality that's only recently falling apart. Japan never adopted that mentality, and it's just as legitimate form of storytelling as books or live-action shows and movies.","Manga/anime, also known as Japanese comics and cartoons, are incredibly popular in Japan. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Cultural Significance**: Manga and anime have been an integral part of Japanese culture for decades. They have been a source of escapism, entertainment, and inspiration for generations of Japanese people.
2. **Rural Origins**: Many popular manga and anime series originated in rural Japan, where people had limited access to modern technology and entertainment. This led to the development of unique, hand-drawn styles and storytelling techniques that appealed to local audiences.
3. **Collectibility**: Manga and anime are often collected by fans, who purchase individual volumes or episodes of a series. This creates a strong sense of ownership and community among fans, who share their love for the series with others.
4. **Educational Value**: Manga and anime are often used as educational tools in schools, where they are taught as part of the curriculum. This has helped to popularize the medium and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
5. **Community and Social Bonding**: Manga and anime provide a sense of community and social bonding for fans. Fans often share their love for a particular series with others, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared experience.
6. **Influence of Western Culture**: Manga and anime have been heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly Western comics and cartoons. This has led to the creation of new, innovative styles and storytelling techniques that appeal to Western audiences.
7. **High Production Values**: Manga and anime are often produced with high production values, including beautiful artwork, engaging storytelling, and complex themes. This has helped to attract fans from other parts of the world who are drawn to the medium's unique qualities.
8. **Long-Term Fan Base**: Fans of manga and anime often develop a long-term fan base, which can last for decades or even a lifetime. This loyalty and dedication to the medium has contributed to its popularity and influence.

Overall, the popularity of manga/anime in Japan can be attributed to a combination of cultural, economic, and social factors. The medium has evolved over time, incorporating new styles and themes while maintaining its core appeal to fans.<|eot_id|>","I'm not an expert, but I've been interested in manga for a while now. I think it's because manga is a very visual medium. It's a very fast-paced medium that has a very fast-paced story that is easy to follow. I think it's also because it's very easy to create. Manga is very easy to draw, and it's very easy to write. I think it's also because it's very easy to sell. It's a very cheap medium to create, and it's easy to sell. It's also very easy to sell, because it's a very easy medium to sell.<|eot_id|>","Because they are not just comic book stuff. Manga and anime are the only genres where there is a need for a good story. This is especially true of manga that are well written, well thought out, and are often the best in the industry. Anime is an interesting genre, but it is not the most popular. What is the real reason for the huge popularity of anime? Anime has a lot of fans and it has some great fan communities. I have no idea. It just depends on how well you interpret the manga. I am going to ask you this question for what you think of the popularity and popularity. Why do you feel that it matters so much in a comic-book story?","Ive always been interested in manga and anime. I don't know the answer to your question but i read a lot of manga in college and i've always loved the manga. It's like a new form of anime/manga. Now i can't really explain why. The only reason i know is because it is in a genre i like and it has been around for so long. Also, i'm not sure if it would have been popular in the us at the time. If there were a manga market in europe, the american market would be big. In other words, manga was popular and americans liked it. Jyoreans like manga, as it was easier to read and understood. That's why it became a big market. Edit: i should add that the japans also had anime and manga as well. But they were not as widespread as in most of europa. They also tended to be more expensive than in america. Manga would still be popular to judeo-americans, but not so prevalent in asia.

Were all keyboards in this pre-QWERTY style (see image in comments)?,"This keyboard in the picture isn't really that different though, it follows the German version of Qwerty called Qwertz (because of the y/z switch) and with the P and L brought to the lowest rank to even out the amount of keys per rank a bit more. In regard to your history question you could maybe check the earlier topic on the questiob of Qwerty in regard to machines jamming here _URL_0_","Unfortunately, I don't see an image in your comments. However, based on the pre-QWERTY keyboard style, it appears that the keyboard layout was not symmetrical or alphabetical.

In pre-QWERTY keyboards, the keys were often arranged in a grid or a circular pattern, and the keys were not organized by letter or number. Instead, the keys were often grouped by function or category, such as navigation keys, modifier keys, and control keys.

Here's a rough idea of what a pre-QWERTY keyboard might have looked like:

* Navigation keys (e.g., arrow keys, Home, End)
* Modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt)
* Function keys (e.g., F1-F12)
* Navigation keys (e.g., arrow keys, Home, End)
* Modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt)
* Control keys (e.g., F1-F12)
* Common keys (e.g., Delete, Backspace, Tab)

Keep in mind that this is just a rough idea, and the actual keyboard layout may have varied depending on the specific keyboard and manufacturer.<|eot_id|>","Not really. The first typewriter was the [Sholes & Glidden Type-Writer](_URL_0_), and the first typewritten text was the [New York Times](_URL_1_), which was published in 1872. The first typewriter with a keyboard was the [Beechcroft Type Writer](_URL_2_) (1922), and the first electronic typewriter was the [Parker TypeWriter](_URL_3_) (1944). The first electronic typewriter with a keyboard was the [Royal QWERTY](_URL_4_) (1950), and the first modern electronic typewriter with a keyboard was the [IBM 5100](_URL_5_) (1966).<|eot_id|>","I think the best way to describe this is as a kind of an open-ended question. I'll keep that in mind for now, and i'd like to give a little context. When i was a kid, i used to have a very limited range of keyboards. My mother's was the first, so she was very interested in all of my devices. One day i picked up a new keyboard. She said, ""i want a full-size, all-caps, super high-quality, hard-wired, full, touch-sensitive, high quality, flexible, soft, non-slip-stretch, usb type-c, one-handed, with a 100% compatibility."" i didn't understand why. So i went to a shop and bought a keyboard that was just a bit smaller. It was really good. That's where i started, because i don't know how to type. And that's what i did. So i took a look at the keyboard and it was so simple. What i like is that the keys are very much like a regular keyboard, but they are also very tactile. The keys on my keyboard have an almost tactile feel. They are tactile and very precise. There are two different keys, the ""pinch"" and the thumb, which are more tactile than the regular keys. We have one on the left and one in the middle. On the right, you can press a lot of keys at once. This is a really nice touch. You can even have your whole body pressed in different places. For example, if you press the f1 key, it feels like you are in a car. Because of the way it works, when you have the finger on your keyboard you feel it, as if it were in your hand. In fact, that is what it is. If you look closely at what's on there, there is no touchpad. At the end of that, a thumb is not an important part of what you do. As a rule, we have to use our thumb to hold our keys so that we can use them in that way. But i think it's very important that you use your thumb and your fingers to make sure that it does not move when it comes to things. To be honest, for a while, no one used the touch pad. Now that i've talked about the experience, how it worked, what the pros and cons were, let's look back at that experience. Let's start with the fact that there were actually two keys that were very different. First, they had a different feel and feel than a normal keyboard - they were not in sync. Second, not all the time. Both the second and third keys were different, in fact. Right from the start, both of them felt very similar to one another. Even when they came in contact, neither of us had any issues with them. Of course, since it wasn't a problem, my family never had problems with it. All we had to do was change the key. Our family used a hardwired keyboard (which we still use today). I'm not sure if that makes sense. Since that time, people have used keyboards that are not compatible with our keyboard software. However, this keyboard is very well suited for the modern pc. __________________i guess i had the same problem that a typical user had. A few years ago i made the decision to switch to the full version of windows. From the look of things, after a few weeks i realized that this would be the last version that would support windows 8.1. Here's why: first of all, windows 7 and 8 are both available on windows 10. Microsoft also offers a preinstalled version called windows update, available for purchase at microsoft store. With the new windows, users can download it from a pc and run it on their own computer. After the installation, microsoft provides a service called ""windows update."" it's an online service that allows you to download updates for windows to windows xp, vista, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and windows server 2003 r2. These are the versions that get the most updates. While the newer versions of these software are free, many users will pay a small fee for them, to be able to play with their existing software in new environments. Many of those users are using windows for work, or simply because they love it and want to get their hands on it - just to try it out. It's important to note that windows has a couple of major problems. Firstly, while the windows operating system is open, its software is still limited. (the microsoft edge browser is available, although you'll have some issues when trying it at home.) secondly, most users have problems running the operating systems. Unfortunately, though, some users still have issues using their windows vista or windows 2000 operating-systems.

That's how they were developed. They are not designed to be used in a way that is not a more efficient way for typing. So the q10- and q11 were used by typewriters were the most common, and were not common. And so-and they just used for typewriter typeers. Keyboards didn't have more than q. You can't even had different ways to write qrs, for typed more common typewrites. It, q keys.

How does alcohol dry things out?,"Alcohol and water are miscible (they can mix). If you place electronics in alcohol, it will reach all the tiny corners where water is hiding and mix with it, “diluting” the water. Then the alcohol evaporates, so the remaining water is now spread out over such a large volume that it evaporates quickly as well. The detection strips rely on a hydration reaction with water. They probably won’t work with alcohol.","Alcohol can dry out skin and other tissues by several mechanisms:

1. **Dehydration**: Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it increases urine production. When alcohol is absorbed into the skin, it can cause dehydration, leading to dryness and cracking of the skin.
2. **Disruption of skin barrier**: Alcohol can disrupt the natural barrier of the skin, allowing moisture to escape and causing dryness and irritation.
3. **Inhibition of skin's natural moisture barrier**: Alcohol can inhibit the skin's natural moisture barrier, making it harder for the skin to retain moisture and maintain its natural hydration level.
4. **Thermal shock**: Alcohol can cause a sudden increase in temperature, leading to thermal shock and drying out of the skin.
5. **Vasodilation**: Alcohol can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow to the skin. This increased blood flow can cause blood vessels to leak, leading to swelling and irritation.
6. **Reduced blood flow**: Alcohol can also reduce blood flow to the skin, leading to a decrease in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, causing them to become dry and damaged.

In the context of skin care, excessive use of alcohol-based products can lead to dryness, irritation, and even infections. It's essential to use skin care products with minimal alcohol content and to follow a gentle, hydrating skincare routine.

If you're experiencing dry skin or other skin issues, consider the following:

* Use gentle, fragrance-free skincare products.
* Moisturize regularly, especially after bathing or showering.
* Avoid using harsh exfoliants or astringent products.
* Stay hydrated and get enough sleep.
* Consider using natural, hydrating products instead of alcohol-based products.<|eot_id|>","Alcohol is a solvent, meaning it can dissolve (or dissolve) things. In the case of your skin, it can dissolve water and other substances that are dissolved in it. It is also capable of dissolving and removing organic substances. So, when you drink alcohol, it is capable of dissolving water in your skin. When the alcohol is absorbed into your skin, it is absorbed into the water that is dissolved in your skin. So, when the alcohol is absorbed into your skin, it is absorbed into the water in your skin. This means that the water in your skin is being removed from your skin. This causes the skin to dry out, because the water that was dissolved in your skin is being removed.<|eot_id|>","""dry alcohol is the result of oxidation of aldehydes, the natural product of the fermentation of yeast. As the alcohol evaporates, it causes oxidation at the enzyme responsible for making the sugars. The enzymes responsible, however, are unable to act on the yeast as they degrade and become alcohol. To avoid the oxidation, a yeast needs to break down the enzymes in the fermenting process and the resulting alcohol will become more difficult to digest."" i think that is a very interesting answer. It is an excellent way to see what the reaction is going on. It also helps to know that alcohol does not have to be pure to work. I have found that when i was cooking, i would use a lot of sugar and i wouldn't want to add too much to the dish. The next step is to make sure that the ingredients are dry and to ensure that they are not too wet. First, we need to find a suitable way of drying the wine. Here is my idea:1. Use a small amount of vinegar to dry the entire wine and add the dried ingredients to it. 2. Add a tablespoon of water to one of your pots and boil it for 10 minutes. 3. When the water is cool, add some water from the pot to your wine pot. 4. Once the hot water has cooled, pour in a bit of wine to mix with the vinegar. 5. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes to allow the solution to settle. 6. Remove the pots from their boiling position and allow to cool completely. 7. Allow the grapes to sit overnight in your refrigerator and then store in an airtight container. 8. Enjoy!how to make aged wine (wine-yard)i hope this helps you.

For example, alcohol makes you less likely (or even impossible) to clean something. However, in a dry environment, the alcohol isn’t dry. So the object that was previously wet has dried out.~~ edit: the word ""dried"" is a bit misleading. Dry means ""not dry."" alcohol is not dry at the molecular level. Water is. This means it has more energy than just water, but it is still wet. In alcohol, there is less energy in the liquid and more in it. The more water there, more stuff will stick. That means you won‘t be able to wash out things, and the stuff that you do is more difficult to remove from the body. Edit2: it sounds like you misunderstood your question. Alcohol doesn't just dry stuff out, that stuff is also wet, which means the things you are cleaning can also get stuck. **edit3:** the question is what you mean by “dryness”. You should not think of alcohol as being ""less dry"". Alcohol. What does dryness mean? **dry**. Because it can get wet? It doesn“t. Its not. Just be less wet than water. *that‗dry* than dry? Yes. And yes it gets less than moisture. If it‚s not wetness? No. Also less. Not more dry than wet and dry as dry it dry and wet as wet.*. Wet or wet* wet then less water? Not water.* dry.* less dry* dry in water* more wet (more water than in dry then wet*. More than less moisture.* more moisture? *dry.* wet! More. More then dry! Dry or water*. Also more fluid? In more liquid. Less? That's more *more wet *water.* water!* in less! *s wet*, less.* *wet.* or more evaporate?* (dry. Then more, wet again, or dry (and less*.) than liquid.* than stuff. Or less fluid.* water in that less? More like water that has less, less substance. But more substance (like dry material. Same as water as it? Is wet with moisture and water on it (water that is *and* liquid). **more than it, too.** wet to be wet in. Which is dry with water (because it). And less stuff, then it stays in your hand. Thus it evaporates. Like the same. As the water has to dissolve things. (dispersed) things in everything else. Therefore, dry places. Now the answer is, things will evaporated and evaporating. These things are more prone to being wet because they are dry on their own. Hence the dryer things dry more easily, because there are less places for things to dry out (so they can be dried. I guess the meaning is water). So it drier than things that have water to stay. There's less to evaporation. Ie, water can stay in place. Aka, not be more dried than the substance that can dry enough to get washed out too, thus the amount of dry is the wet things is dripped. Etc. Than that water which it does not wash it out of things than anything else that gets wet/so it becomes water too much. Without water and it goes out the drips. All the drink water will dry you can become dry because of the substances. Your body is made of water less able. To become water again become wet too dry for the person. Everything. Yes, you become less of wet for a person who you wash off. They become more susceptible to water then anything that your hands dry/dry and your clothes become washed. Are wet if you drink.

Oh water becomes wet so all water or that dry that go out everything becomes air. Things become dried and you have to go dryed. Is all dry but less liquid that became water for you. Anything becomes less air that makes up. Any more that does become a wet all is that stays dry becomes a substance becomes the thing.

I know what you are talking about. But if you want a way to get around this, you have to do it yourself. This is my personal approach. Step 1: this method is not for the faint of heart. No matter what the reason, it is an extremely effective way of getting around the rules and regulations of reddit. You will learn how to use it in a few short hours and you will have a very clear understanding of the subreddit's rules. So, no matter how many times you try to break the ""rules"" or how much you fail to follow them, i will still help you. Step 2: if you think that you can get away with it, do yourself a favor and sign up for a free account. A free one is a great way for you to learn about reddit and how it works and get started. Now, if it's not free, well, why not sign it up and give it a try? This will make it much easier to set up your own account and start your new life. Then, the best thing is that it will be free. If it doesn't work, try signing up on the free page. That way, once you understand how the site works, and it has your back, then you'll be able to start using it. Let's go through the steps below.1. Create a new account2. Get your username and password3. Check your email to see if your account is registered4. Sign up to your free membership page5. Go to the new page on your browser and click ""login""6. After that, click on ""update"" and enter your password. _______________7. The new site will appear and your name will start appearing.

When the login page is complete, check your spam folder and add it to that. In this folder, create a file called ""scam folder"" which contains all your files. Copy the file and paste it into your ""scam folder"" . ___________________________10. For this example, we are going to put our spam folders in the spam directory. We will use the default settings for this one. First, edit the . Scm file (which is in your default directory).11. Open the "". Scmp"" file. It should look something like this:12. Right click and select ""save target as..."". Enter your current password and save it here. (you can also open the folder on another computer to save the files, or just copy and past your old .

How are news agencies allowed to outright spread lies or misinformation to the public? Why is there no system of moderation to license news reporters similar to how engineers/doctors are licensed to design buildings or treat patients?,"Who would do the moderation? The government? This is what happens in some countries, such as Russia and the UAE, and the governments in those countries influence the news to suit their own agenda.  The UK had an independent Press Complaints Commission which does try to keep the news sane, even if that means censuring the government. If you wanted to try that in the USA, it would probably require an Act of Congress, and it wouldn't get past your current highly-partisan Congress.","I'll provide an explanation, but please note that the spread of lies and misinformation is a complex issue with deep-seated societal and technological factors.

**Regulatory Framework:**

In the United States, news agencies are not licensed to spread lies or misinformation in the same way that engineers or doctors are. However, they are subject to various regulations and guidelines:

1. **Fact-checking organizations:** Independent fact-checking organizations, like Snopes or FactCheck.org, help verify the accuracy of news reports. While these organizations are not officially affiliated with news agencies, they can provide valuable feedback on the accuracy of specific stories.
2. **Journalism standards:** News agencies adhere to strict journalistic standards, such as fact-checking and verifying sources. However, these standards are not always enforced, and some agencies may prioritize sensationalism over accuracy.
3. **Industry guidelines:** Major news organizations, like CNN, NBC, and Fox, have internal guidelines and codes of conduct that emphasize fact-checking, accuracy, and responsible reporting.

**Lack of Systemic Moderation:**

There are several reasons why news agencies can spread lies or misinformation:

1. **Anonymity:** Many news outlets publish bylines that conceal the identity of their contributors. This makes it difficult to hold individuals accountable for spreading misinformation.
2. **Lack of accountability:** News agencies often lack formal accountability mechanisms, such as editorial boards or ombudsmen, to investigate and correct errors.
3. **Information overload:** The sheer volume of news reports and online content can lead to a ""noise-to-signal"" problem, where the signal of fact-based reporting is drowned out by sensationalism and misinformation.
4. **Social media amplification:** Social media platforms can amplify misinformation, making it difficult to correct or retract false information.
5. **Censorship and self-censorship:** Some news outlets may self-censor or downplay sensitive or contentious topics to avoid offending certain groups or individuals.
6. **Lack of regulation:** The news media landscape is largely unregulated, allowing misinformation to spread unchecked.

**Industry Response:**

To address these issues, some news outlets have implemented various measures, such as:

1. **Fact-checking initiatives:** Many news outlets now have dedicated fact-checking teams or partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations.
2. **Investigative reporting:** Some outlets prioritize investigative reporting, which involves in-depth research and fact-checking to uncover the truth.
3. **Collaboration with fact-checking organizations:** News outlets may partner with independent","If you're talking about the US news media, then there's a system in place. Every news agency has a license from the FCC, and they have to pay a fee for it. There's a system in place for reporting, which is based on a code of ethics. This code of ethics is designed to help prevent reporters from getting in trouble. For example, if a reporter breaks the code of ethics, and gets caught, they can be fired. But if a reporter breaks the code of ethics, and gets caught, they can be fined. The FCC also has a system in place for reporting, which is based on a rating system.

It's also a bad thing because if you have a system where you can't license a news agency that has been exposed as a lie, you would be out of business. I've seen many people in the news industry who've been told they have to stop reporting on stories because they were exposed for breaking news. They don't want to. This is an issue i think needs to go much deeper. If you look at the way news is used and manipulated, the more people are exposed to it, and the less they believe in it. When the media's reputation is taken away, it's not only less of a press, but more of an ideological, corporate media. The truth is, if there is one thing we can all do, then it is to make sure that the truth isn't out there. And that's exactly what i believe about the need for a media that is open to all. But i don' t see how it can be done without changing the rules.","Ive heard that the rules are that reporters are not allowed inside the building. I would guess that you would also be able to report the truth if you have some sort of legal obligation to provide the information. That being said, if a reporter is going to lie, it's important to know the facts. If the story is untrue, the reporter must be held accountable and the result of the investigation must go to a special prosecutor. In some cases, like the one in the movie ""the hunt for the mole,"" the police have to get a warrant for a specific area, and then they will ask for that specific warrant to investigate. This is because the search warrant was issued by a judge, not the media. It is a matter of fact that a newspaper is allowed in a building, but not in any building in which a journalist is permitted to be present. The news organization has to have a lawyer present to testify in court. Edit: also, in case you're wondering, no, this isn't about *lies*. The laws of war are different than the law of international relations. There is no law against lying, because war is illegal. So the only laws against lies are relevant to international affairs. A war can be applicable to war. No laws that apply to lying. For war, war must apply only to non-war. War for non war: war and war in international law. Just like war cannot apply for peace. Also war applies to any war if war *if war has a law that war or war (or war between two wars. You can't apply even if it applies for law, that law to all war? The same law applies even though you know war with war... War that's different laws apply. And vice versa. To no war without war depends on war the war - war you are laws. Even war only war laws in general. Both of nations can apply laws between war apply in war may be illegal, though there are rules. Tl;dr: you must declare war against war to rule. All laws are in order to apply the world. Or not war; war on the rule applies. Etc. Laws vary. Those are the answers are more general rules for all apply, i'm not sure. But i hope that helps.

The difference between a learning disability and an intellectual disability.,"Intellectual disability - basically I'm not smart enough. Learning disability - I can't learn via specific processes. Often characterized by senses I.e. auditory processing disorder. You can't learn something by hearing instructions, but given picture instructions it's easy to learn the same thing.  If a cup represents your ability to learn, a really small cup is an intellectual disability. A cup with a lid that has circular holes means the cup can only be filled a certain way (or certain ways, really).","The main differences between a learning disability and an intellectual disability are:

1. **Definition:** Learning disabilities are a group of conditions that affect an individual's ability to learn and understand, while intellectual disabilities are a broader category of conditions that affect cognitive functioning, including learning, memory, and problem-solving.

2. **Severity:** Learning disabilities can range from mild to severe, while intellectual disabilities are typically more severe, affecting a person's overall cognitive abilities.

3. **Impact on Daily Life:** Learning disabilities may not significantly impact a person's daily life, while intellectual disabilities can have a more significant impact on daily life, affecting work, relationships, and overall well-being.

4. **Cognitive Abilities:** Learning disabilities may affect specific areas of cognitive functioning, such as memory, attention, or processing speed, while intellectual disabilities affect a broader range of cognitive abilities, including problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity.

5. **Treatment and Support:** Learning disabilities often require more targeted and specific support, such as accommodations in education or work, while intellectual disabilities may require more comprehensive support, including therapy, counseling, and social support.

6. **Diagnostic Criteria:** The diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities are different. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) distinguishes between learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities, with the former being a more specific category.

7. **Causes and Risk Factors:** The causes and risk factors for learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities are distinct. Learning disabilities are often caused by genetic or environmental factors, while intellectual disabilities are often caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.

It's essential to note that both learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities can co-occur, and individuals with one condition may also have symptoms of the other. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial to support individuals with learning disabilities or intellectual disabilities and to promote their overall well-being.<|eot_id|>","A learning disability is a learning disorder, which is a neurological condition. It is a disorder that affects the way the brain processes information. A learning disability is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to process information. An intellectual disability is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to learn. It is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to learn. It is not the same as a learning disability.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""learning disability"". I think you mean a learning disorder. A learning disorder is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to process information. An intellectual disability is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to learn.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""intellectual disability"". I think you mean a learning disorder.<|eot_id|>","This question is a bit of a mystery. I can't really tell you the answer to this question because i'm a neuroscientist and i've always been interested in the subject of learning. But i think there are a few things that are relevant. First, you may be able to learn from someone who has been trained to do so. Second, the person may also be aware of the social situation that they are in. Finally, people with learning disabilities may not be well informed about the kinds of things they need to know. The problem is that the question of whether or not a person has an ability to read is rather fuzzy. In the literature, a reading disability is defined as one that is limited to a single set of abilities. So a disability that has no set abilities is not considered an intelligence. And it is difficult to say whether it's an iq, or a physical disability, because we know that most people who have learning impairments have no ability at all to use these abilities as they actually do. If you have a developmental disability with a number of talents, it would be possible for you to be very good at reading, but that doesn't mean that you are not able. It might be difficult for some people to understand that their abilities are limited, and they might not even be capable of doing so at the level that one would expect. The same goes for a mental disability: it might mean you don't know what to expect, even if you do know it. Some people, like me, have trouble with this sort of thing. However, i do think that there is an enormous amount of research that can be done to better understand the brain. There is so much to study and so many different kinds. We've all had to deal with it in different ways, so i would say that some of what we're doing is really fascinating.","~~learning disability~~ intellectual disabilities are defined as a disorder of the brain or a specific set of areas of it. Learning to speak, write, speak at a high level, or speak in a foreign language are considered learning disabilities. A child who cannot learn to read or write is not a learned person. The term is used to refer to the inability to understand or understand speech in an abstract way. You can be a genius, an accountant, a scientist, but not have the capacity to be intelligent.~~ edit: spelling. Spelling is the ability to think, think abstractly, and think logically. For example, i can't understand how to draw in the paper, so i have an ____ disability (not a neurological disability, just a developmental one). A person who can understand the concept of a word is an amirite (the ability of an individual to communicate with others). The word ""amir"" is a form of intellectual impairment, meaning that it lacks the skills necessary to become an engineer or engineer. I'm not sure if that's what you mean, though. Edit 2: grammar. Grammar is like a language. So the way a sentence is written is just like how you speak. If you have a grammar defect, it's like an english language, the sentence you are speaking in. It has a different meaning. However, if someone says ""i'm deaf"" in english, that means you're speaking ""you're deaf. This means i am deaf, this is my deaf."" so ""this is deaf"". So you know that i cant understand that you understand english is it, can you think that is i understand it is that, because i speak english. Someone with that could be my. My brain is ""s"" meaning deaf is mine. There is *not* deaf as well. That can they are deaf! (if you could just not understand what that. _____, you don't have this language is, like i know it and speak i. Is what i, is _______. They cant. Not ______________, they can not be deaf = i is. (edit 3: i could not speak with mine and i ______. Or i couldn't. Don______. But they could understand. **lack a mental defect.**. And so on. Also, ""learning"" isn't like having a speech impediment (i cannot understand, not learned, as you say). Edit 3. Speech is one. Language can also has mental retardation. As i don; it can.

Why do I get headaches from 3D movies?,"Order some [2-D Glasses](_URL_1_). Yeah, they're a real thing. They cancel out the double image and just give you a flat normal movie.","There are several reasons why you might experience headaches from 3D movies. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Motion Sickness**: The combination of fast-paced movements and rapid changes in direction can cause motion sickness, which can lead to headaches. This is more common in older adults or those with pre-existing conditions.
2. **Eye Strain**: Watching 3D movies can cause eye strain due to the intense focusing required. This can lead to fatigue, which can manifest as headaches.
3. **Head Positioning**: People may position their heads at an unnatural angle to see the 3D images, which can lead to discomfort and headaches.
4. **Sound Distortion**: Some 3D movies can cause sound distortion, which can be disorienting and lead to headaches.
5. **Sensitivity to Light**: The bright lights used in 3D movies can cause sensitivity to light, leading to headaches in some individuals.
6. **Motion Paralysis**: This is a rare condition where the brain and muscles become paralyzed due to prolonged exposure to 3D movies, leading to headaches.
7. **Pre-existing Conditions**: If you have pre-existing conditions such as migraines, sinus pressure, or other neurological conditions, you may be more prone to headaches from 3D movies.

To minimize headaches from 3D movies, you can try the following:

- Take breaks to rest your eyes and head.
- Adjust the lighting in the theater to reduce glare.
- Choose seats that are farther away from the screen.
- Consider watching 2D movies instead.
- Follow the instructions of the theater staff if they provide them.
- Consult with a healthcare professional if you experience frequent or severe headaches.<|eot_id|>","The reason why you get headaches from 3D movies is because your eyes are moving around. When you are watching a 3D movie, your eyes are moving in a circle. The reason why you get headaches is because your brain is not able to process all the information at once. Your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world. When your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world, it gets tired. This tiredness is what causes headaches. The reason why 3D movies work is because they are not like a 2D movie. Your brain is not able to process all the information at once. It can only process 2D information at a time. So when you are watching a 3D movie, your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world.

I have always been a little nervous about my body, especially my joints. However, with this new drug i started to see that my pain is not going away. After a while i had this idea. My joints are starting to feel better. At first i thought i could just use a pain medication. But then i realized that i really don`t want my arthritis to go away because i do not want it to be too big. The more i try, however, it gets worse. Now i know how i need it and i see it as a means to my health, to alleviate my symptoms. What i am trying to do is make my knees feel more natural. That is, my thighs. My ankles. That is all i need. All i really need is a big toe. The only way i feel like i could change my feet is if i use my legs and my arms. And i just keep trying. It just keeps getting worse and worse, until i finally get a small toe that will fit in my shoe. Then i feel so happy, because my toes are so natural and perfect. Then i go to bed and get up and start my morning routine.1. Have you tried any of these other drugs? If so, how have you felt about them all? : the first time i tried them was in the back of me. A few months ago i did a lot of research and found out that they can make your body feel much more active and full. They also can increase your immune system and help you fight infection. And they make you feel really strong. Some of their symptoms are: headache, nausea, numbness and shortness of breath. Also, there is more of an anti-inflammatory effect than a placebo. These drugs give your muscles more time to grow and contract. Your body is so full and supple that this helps you heal. A lot depends on how much you put in your diet. To increase the body's immune response, try these drugs :- buprofen,*bupropion,*lentrone,methionine, tryptophan, prozac, vibram, triclosan. Use these for a long time. (i used them for about 8 years.)2. How do you know if these medicines work? Do you see any side effects? How would you describe them to your doctor? What are some of your side effect symptoms and what can you tell","Ive heard that the motion sickness is caused by the stereoscopic 3-d effect. It basically means that when you take two pictures at the same time, you will see each one of them as being 3 dimensional. So when the movies are being shown at different times, the picture will appear to be 3 dimensions. And when they are shown over and over, they will look like 2d. I don't know how it works for movies, but i guess it's a case of ""you are seeing a 3rd image, your brain thinks that it is 3"" and thinks it looks like a 2nd image. Then it goes into a sort of 3:1 conversion, which is why it seems to work for most people. Hope that helps. Edit: here's the link: _url_0_ there is also a youtube channel called ""3d sickness"" where you can watch 3ds movies. If you want to watch the movie in full 3. D, watch it in 3 and 4 dimensions instead of 2 and 3, and then watch both movies in 2, 3 & 4, then you'll have to go to the theater. The 3/4 version is a bit different.

Why do people have different skin colours?,"Different skin colours help in different climates, darker skin tones nearer the equator, lighter towards the North and south poles etc","People have different skin colors due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Melanin**: Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color. There are two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is responsible for brown and black skin colors, while pheomelanin produces red and yellow skin colors.
2. **Genetics**: Skin color is determined by the amount and distribution of melanin in the skin. People with darker skin colors have more melanin in their skin, which gives them a darker hue.
3. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to sunlight can cause melanin production to increase, resulting in darker skin colors. This is why people from tropical regions often have darker skin colors.
4. **Evolutionary History**: The distribution of melanin in the skin is also influenced by an individual's evolutionary history. People from regions with high levels of melanin production, such as the Amazon rainforest, have more melanin in their skin, resulting in darker skin colors.

The combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the variation in skin colors across different populations. Here's a rough breakdown:

- **Dark Skin**: People from tropical regions, such as those in Africa, Asia, and Indigenous Australia, often have darker skin colors due to high levels of melanin production.
- **Medium Skin**: People from temperate regions, such as those in Europe, North America, and parts of Australia, typically have medium skin colors due to moderate levels of melanin production.
- **Light Skin**: People from regions with low levels of melanin production, such as those in Northern Europe, Mediterranean, and parts of South America, often have lighter skin colors.

Keep in mind that these are general explanations, and there's a lot of variation within each group. Additionally, skin color can be influenced by other factors, such as hormonal changes, diet, and exposure to certain chemicals.<|eot_id|>","Humans are a lot like plants. We have a lot of different genes that determine our traits. When we're born, we have all of these genes and the ones that are active determine how our skin, hair, eyes, and other traits will be. So if you have a gene for dark skin, you will have darker skin. If you have a gene for light skin, you will have lighter skin. There are also genes that are active in other parts of our bodies, like the eyes. So if you have a gene for blue eyes, you will have blue eyes. If you have a gene for brown eyes, you will have brown eyes. So the skin, hair, eyes, and other traits are all determined by genes. When we're born, we have all of these genes active. So when we're growing up, the genes that are active determine what traits we'll have.<|eot_id|>","I'm not sure what it's about, but it seems to be a cultural phenomenon. If you're looking for something that's not as obvious as what's in the skin then i'd love to hear from you. I'm a big fan of the beauty side of beauty and i've always been a huge fan. My favorite color is my favourite color. If you like that, why not give me a shout out!so, with that out of it, what do you think of our new theme? Let us know below and leave your thoughts below.","~~some people are born with darker skin color than others.~~ it's a learned trait, not a universal one. As far as i know, it is not the case that every person has a different set of skin colors. The skin in our skin is dark, while the rest of our body is clear. So, the most common color we see is our own skin, and not our natural skin. Edit: [here](_url_0_) is a good article with some more info. Hope that helps. I hope it helps! Edit 2: this is the ""normal"" skin of my skin tone. This isn't really true for all people. Some people can have more melanin in their skin than other people, so if you have a lot of melanocytes in your skin it makes it appear darker to you. That's not to say that your darker isn’t a genetic trait. It just so happens that it‘s not uncommon for people to have darker pigmentation than someone else. You can see this in some animals (the melanoma in the human eye is more common than the melanomas in other animals) because of the presence of pigment in different parts of your body. And it happens more often in humans. People with lighter skin tones also have lighter pigmented skin that is also common. [more common in animals]( _url_1_).

"How did girlscout cookies get to be so good, and why don't corporations with much more money make better cookies?",Keebler makes them. They are plenty successful with their own brands of cookies as well. They have no problem selling GS cookies as their best ones because they can charge $4 a box (more than most) and people think its for a good cause. Also only thin mints and samoas are any good. The other ones suck ass.,"Girl Scout cookies have been a beloved treat for generations, and their popularity can be attributed to several factors. Here's a brief history and some reasons why Girl Scout cookies are still considered some of the best:

**Early beginnings:** Girl Scout cookies were first introduced in 1917 by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The first recipe was a simple chocolate chip cookie made with just a few ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and chocolate chips.

**Quality over quantity:** Over the years, the Girl Scouts refined their cookie recipe, focusing on quality ingredients and careful baking. They used high-quality chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract to create a rich, delicious flavor.

**Quality control:** To ensure consistency and quality, the Girl Scouts developed a strict quality control process. They tested their cookies in small batches, using only the finest ingredients and a rigorous testing protocol.

**No shortcuts:** Unlike some other cookie manufacturers, the Girl Scouts didn't rely on shortcuts or preservatives to extend shelf life. Their cookies were baked fresh daily, using traditional baking methods that preserved the natural flavors and textures.

**Attention to detail:** The Girl Scouts are known for their attention to detail, from the packaging to the branding. Their iconic brown paper bags, colorful labels, and ""Treat of the Month"" promotions have become synonymous with the brand.

**Why corporations don't make better cookies:**

1. **Overemphasis on quantity over quality:** Companies often prioritize mass production over quality ingredients and careful baking. This can result in cookies that are bland, overly sweet, or lacking in flavor.
2. **Lack of transparency:** Companies may not disclose the exact ingredients or manufacturing processes used in their cookies. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for consumers to trust the product.
3. **Preservatives and additives:** Some companies may use preservatives or additives to extend shelf life, which can affect the natural flavor and texture of the cookie.
4. **Shortcuts and automation:** Companies may rely on automated production lines or shortcuts to save time and money, which can result in cookies that are inconsistent or lacking in quality.
5. **Focus on profit over people:** Companies may prioritize profits over people, focusing on mass production and cost-cutting measures rather than investing in quality ingredients and careful baking.

**Why Girl Scout cookies stand out:**

1. **Quality ingredients:** The Girl Scouts use only the finest ingredients, including real butter and high-quality chocolate.
2. **Attention to detail:** The Girl Scouts' attention to detail, from the packaging to the","The Girl Scouts have a strict recipe that they stick to. They don't allow any variation, except for things like the color of the cookies. They also don't allow any additives, except for salt. They also make their own sugar, and their own flour. They also bake their own cookies in small batches, and they have a very low turnover rate. This allows them to keep their cookies fresh, and they also keep the cookies from getting stale. They also have a lot of control over what goes into the cookies. They can choose the flavor, and the color, and they can choose the amount of sugar, and the amount of butter. They can also choose the size of the cookies, and the shape. This allows them to make the cookies exactly what you want, and they don't have to rely on a third party to make the cookies. They are also very proud of their cookies, and they like to show them off.<|eot_id|>","They don, but not all companies make cookies. Http://www. Bouncytheadventures. Com/blog/2014/01/17/why-can-corporations-make-good-cookie-counters. Htmlthe last question is the one about how to make good cookies (the one where the cookie is made and what it does). What is good cookie?so let's look at the cookies we make and how they are made. To start, let me start with the good and bad cookies:i have a few things to say about the bad and good. Bad cookies are the ones that are almost always made from sugar, sugar-free, or even a combination of both. Good cookies will be made of a variety of ingredients, most of which are not used in the traditional cookie making process. In fact, they usually make a lot of the things that make up good food. But they also have to do with how the food is prepared. For example, it is usually a good idea to use the best ingredients for the ingredients used to create good foods. I will also mention that these ingredients are usually not added to the recipe, so they can be added in a different way. The good thing is that good ingredients like sugar and water are often used for all of these. This is why most recipes that use these are still made with sugar. Good cookies come from a number of sources. One of them is from local farmers who are using sugar cane, which is also used as a substitute for butter. Another is a company that is using a mixture of sugar from cane and corn. So when you make the same cookies twice, you will have the right mixture. However, the difference is, when it comes to making the exact same recipe twice (and it will not be the way you would like it to), it makes the whole recipe much less effective. And, that's why i use a much better recipe. Here are some of my favorite recipes for making good biscuits. You can also see the recipes i make with other ingredients such as butter, milk, eggs, spices, etc. In my book, the good, bad, & unhealthy cookbook. What you see above is just a small sample of what i do, although it has been a long time since i have made anything like this. As for how much to pay for these, i am not sure. Most people will pay a little more than $5 for a cookie, for example. Some will even pay $20 for an extra cookie. Other people may pay less for them, depending on their taste. That is not to mention, if you are a restaurant owner, your employees, employees at a local restaurant, workers at your local grocery store, a family member or friends, even some employees in your neighborhood, many of whom will probably pay you a bit more. If you don' want to have these cookies, dont buy them. Just buy your good ones. Let's say you want a recipe like the above. There are many good recipes out there, just like here. It is really not necessary to know every single one of those. Also, try to get as many as you can out of your home. Don't just buy everything you need. Buy what you really need and make it as good as possible. When you find the perfect recipe for your specific needs, make sure you buy it in bulk. Your store will usually have it. Now, as i mentioned above, there are always people who will want the most from their cookies and will need to buy more for their special needs. They will find a way to save money and don`t want their money going to a store. A good store usually has a freebie on sale. These stores have an ""ask a store"" section where they will give you some coupons for free cookies for specific items. Sometimes they even have some free coupons. Usually, these coupons are listed in order of how good the product is. Ask a place where you live, what kind of products you like, how many you have, where it goes, prices and other details. Be sure to ask them questions. Do not ask any of this on your own. Even if they do ask it on a regular basis, ask questions to see what they think. Tell them that you think it works. All of you. Good luck.","Ian kershaw has written a lot on this subject in the past. You can read the entire thing [here](_url_0_). Basically, companies are trying to make money by selling cookies to people. The company that makes the cookies is trying not to lose money but to get people to buy the product. That's why some companies do this, to sell to their customers so that they can make more profit. Other companies have other ways of making money, like by giving you a coupon to use at the store. This is how the girl scout cookie company got the name recognition and other publicity. Edit: to add to this whole thing, when you buy a cookie from a company, it is a part of their profits. When they buy it from you, they pay you for the cookie. If you don’t use it, you have to pay them back. Also, the companies that make these cookies do not make as much money as they make from selling them, because they are not making as many cookies as you do. They have a bigger incentive to do so. So, in essence, if the girls scout cookies company is making more, then they will make less money. I guess it”s because of the advertising, which is why they sell less and sell more. But it doesn‘t matter if it gets the same amount. It makes more for other people, but not more sales. As long as it sells more cookies. No one will buy from them. Tl;dr: it all i hope this helps. Hope that helps someone else will answer your question. :) edit 2nd part 2: i love it. Thanks for reading the good luck, thanks! Edit 3: if anyone else i am the first part is the best part.

"On a lower gravity planet, would it be possible to jump high enough that you could injure yourself when you land? Or would it be impossible for the impact to be that severe?","Assuming no atmosphere, the force it takes to launch from the surface would be equal to the force of collision with the surface upon landing. So the gravity of the planet doesn't matter - the question of whether you can injure yourself is dependent solely on the force you can exert with your legs.","On a lower gravity planet, the concept of ""jumping"" might be different from what we're used to on Earth. The lower gravity would likely affect the trajectory and landing of an object or person.

In a lower gravity environment, objects would experience a greater downward acceleration, which means they would fall faster and cover more distance in a given time. This could result in a higher impact upon landing.

However, the severity of an impact would still depend on various factors, such as:

1. **Object size and shape**: A larger, irregularly shaped object would be more likely to cause significant damage upon landing. A smaller, spherical object would be less likely to cause significant damage.
2. **Object velocity**: The higher the object's velocity upon impact, the more severe the damage would be.
3. **Landing surface**: The type of surface the object lands on would affect the impact. A hard surface would be more likely to cause severe damage than a soft surface.
4. **Gravity**: Even on a lower gravity planet, the gravitational force would still be present. However, the reduced gravity might make it more challenging to control the object's descent.

Given these factors, it's likely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment. However, the severity of the impact would still depend on the specific conditions.

To illustrate this, consider the following scenarios:

* If an object were to land on a hard surface in a lower gravity environment, it could be severely injured due to the rapid deceleration upon impact.
* If an object were to land on a soft surface, such as a thick layer of foam or a large, soft-bodied creature, it might be less likely to cause significant damage.
* If an object were to land in a very low gravity environment, such as on a moon or a planet with a very low surface gravity, the object might be able to cover more distance in a given time, leading to a higher impact upon landing.

In summary, while the lower gravity environment would likely result in a higher impact upon landing, the severity of the impact would still depend on various factors. It's unlikely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment, but the impact would still be significant.<|eot_id|>","You could land on a planet with a very low gravity and still be able to injure yourself. The problem is that the gravity would be so low, you wouldn't be able to jump very high. But the impact would still be very severe. If you are on a planet with a gravity of 1g, you could jump 3-4 times your height and still land with a high velocity, and be injured. But if the gravity is 1/10th that of earth, you could jump 10 times your height and still land with a low velocity, and not be injured. So, yes, you could injure yourself by jumping very high, but it would be very unlikely.<|eot_id|>","I think that the earth would be pretty much in the middle of the solar system. However, i'd like to think, that it would still be a matter of some degree of gravity. If you have a planet that is in a low gravity system, you can probably land on it, but if you are on an earth, it's going to have some sort of gravitational effect on your body. I think there is some kind of influence of light. So the question is, how much of an influence is there on the body of a high gravity earth? I'm not sure. There are lots of possibilities. Some of them are obvious, some of those are not. But i don't think you should be too surprised. What do you think?posted by chris at 9:38 am","~~it's not impossible~~ if you jump far enough, you will fall over. The force of gravity is the same on every side of you, so it's possible. But the strength of your fall will be much lower than that of the gravity you are falling on, and you'll experience the equivalent of a massive earthquake.~~ the higher you go, the more likely you become to fall. This is why it is important to not fall on the moon. As you descend, your gravitational force is so weak that the forces of earth and moon cancel out, leaving you with a much greater chance of falling. On earth, gravity can be stronger than on mars. So you can safely jump higher than you would on an earth-sized planet. Edit: i should add that on any planet with no atmosphere, there is a minimum amount of pressure to keep the air from escaping the atmosphere. It would be extremely difficult to land on such a planet without a significant amount. I would not worry about the pressure. However, on other planets, if the planet is very far from the sun, air is not a limiting factor. If it was too thin, it could be dangerous. [here](_url_0_) is an article on air resistance in a gas planetoids. Atmospheric pressure can cause a small change in pressure on top of an atmosphere (this is what causes the effect of air pressure). Edit2: the paper on low pressure, [this paper]( _url](0](http://_1_), [see also](://www._url._1/5/2/0/1/) is on atmospheric density and [wiki](/_url0_. ](_url_-1/-1/_0_-2/_1_-0._) edit3](https://u/u.5/_3/_u._).~~edit3/r/k/i/o/l/s/t/g/h/p/m/f/a/v/d/c/e/x/b/y/z/n/q/on_d_a_at_earth. Jpg on [earth, this would have a very small difference in atmospheric conditions. You might be able to escape. (or not so much so close.](/url_.~~) on some planets it may be easier to get hit by a meteor than others. > or in space. Just a few inches. With the difference would also be difficult, due to the fact that it might not be too hard to hit the surface. A comet or a little more. For a couple of feet. Or something. There might also make landing on something heavier. And not as easy. Maybe a drop in height. ???? Edit 3.1: edit 2: note that at the end, i'm not sure i just for gravity, a bit. In the article it doesn't say it has to go at all. Sorry about this. Also, in general, not that's how it depends on how far it hits the earth. No. At high gravity. Not much. Any given pressure will happen. High pressure would you get pushed down. Even if gravity = 0.4 inches from earth's gravity it will not. Gravity has a slight difference. Tldr: gravity wouldnt. Low enough pressure is also not all at earths. Which would hurt. Please correct me. _not. Edited. To clarify. That. Yes, no gravity might have more pressure and pressure in low. Would kill you fall at any distance. When hit. Is hard. Small. Too small to say hit earth (earth and earth would hit on. Surface? 1.0. Earth at higher pressure = higher. Lower pressure for impact. More impact? 2. Impact could it happens. Pressure of impact 2 = 1/4 of atmosphere pressure? No matter. **edit 2/3 of atmospheric. Same as earth in earth/pressure. 1-1.2 gravity of moon=0 = gravity in atmosphere to planet/earth (more pressure difference of planet=higher pressure (higher) 2 of mass of water. Higher gravity (same distance/higher altitude) of surface gravity/surface of mars = more gravity 2dissolved in gravity(higher). At lower height of ground. All these are the effects will have different pressures. These would apply. Thus yes. Of course the impacts would happen if i am not able. Hit a moon would. Then hit it. Will the iss, or moon = impactor on moon (0,0). If earth > earth=low pressure at impact, yes or impact on surface (in a low gravity on water would cause it to make it a bigger. See it very hard enough to do. Here. *then* a tiny. Some distance at first. Could not happen to"

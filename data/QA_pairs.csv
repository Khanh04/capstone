in football whats the point of wasting the first two plays with a rush - up the middle - not regular rush plays i get those,"Running plays up the middle serves multiple strategic purposes in football. First, it keeps the defense honest - they can't just focus on defending passes if they know you might run. Second, these plays help tire out the defensive line and test their formation. Even if these runs only gain a few yards, they set up play-action passes later in the game where the defense might fall for a fake run, leading to big passing plays.",1
Why are different tiers (regular < mid < premium) of gas' prices almost always 10 cents different?,Gas prices between tiers aren't always exactly 10 cents different - this varies by region and station. The price difference reflects both the higher production cost of premium gas (which requires additional refining) and market positioning. Stations often use simple price gaps to make it easier for customers to understand the difference between tiers.,1
Stars and Visibility,"When you look directly at a dim star, you're actually using the least sensitive part of your eye. Your eye's central vision is great for detail and color but poor at detecting faint light. Looking slightly to the side of a star uses your peripheral vision, which is much better at detecting dim light. This is why stars sometimes seem to ""pop"" into view when you're not looking directly at them.",1
How do we know all the money the government is getting from bank settlements is going back to the people?,"Government settlements with banks typically go into general government funds or specific programs outlined in the settlement agreement. While some money may go toward consumer protection or restitution programs, much of it becomes part of the government's overall budget. The settlement terms are public records, but tracking exactly how every dollar is spent can be challenging due to how government budgets work.",1
What are good and bad sides of manual and automatic drive gear?,"Manual and automatic transmissions each have distinct advantages. Manual transmissions typically provide better fuel efficiency and give drivers more control over the car's power delivery. They're also usually cheaper to repair. Automatic transmissions offer easier driving, especially in traffic, and are more accessible to new drivers. However, they're generally more complex to repair and slightly less fuel-efficient.",1
How do muscles grow?,"Muscle growth happens through a process called hypertrophy. When you exercise, you create tiny tears in your muscle fibers. During rest, your body repairs these tears by fusing muscle fibers together and adding more protein strands. Think of it like repairing a rope - instead of just fixing the breaks, your body adds extra strands to make it stronger. This is why both exercise and rest are crucial for muscle growth, along with proper nutrition to provide building materials.",1
Why does the water from my kitchen faucet taste different than the water from my bathroom faucet? Doesn't it come from the same place?,"While water comes from the same main source, its taste can differ between faucets due to the pipes it travels through. Different rooms might have pipes made of different materials (like copper versus PVC), and older pipes might have more mineral buildup. The length and temperature of the pipes can also affect how long water sits in them, changing its taste.",1
"If dark colours absorb more heat, why does light skin burn easier than dark skin?","Sunburns aren't actually caused by heat - they're caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Dark skin contains more melanin, a pigment that acts like a natural sunscreen by absorbing UV rays before they can damage deeper skin cells. It's similar to wearing a dark umbrella that blocks more sunlight than a light one. While darker colors do absorb more heat, the protective effect of melanin against UV rays is more important for preventing sunburn.",1
How the fuck does Facebook know about people I know?!,"Facebook uses multiple data sources to suggest connections. It looks at your phone's contact list (if you've given permission), email contacts, work and school information you've provided, and mutual friends. It also considers location data and can recognize when you're frequently in the same place as others. These data points help Facebook build a map of possible connections.",1
Why is chickenpox worse as an adult?,"Chickenpox is typically worse for adults because of how our immune system changes with age. Children's immune systems are still developing and respond more moderately to the virus. Adult immune systems react more aggressively, causing stronger inflammation and more severe symptoms. It's like having a stronger army that fights harder but also causes more collateral damage in the process.",1
How do movies not get uploaded online in HD from movie theater employees before their DVD release?,"Movie theaters protect against leaks through multiple security measures. The digital movie files are encrypted and require special keys to play. Theaters also use watermarking technology to trace leaks back to specific locations, and employees sign strict contracts with heavy penalties for violations. Additionally, many theaters use security cameras and restrict recording devices in projection rooms.",1
Can defense attorneys 'throw' a case if they know their clients are guilty?,"Defense attorneys cannot legally ""throw"" a case, even if they know their client is guilty. Their role is to ensure the justice system follows proper procedures and protects everyone's rights. Intentionally providing poor defense would violate legal ethics and the constitutional right to fair representation. It's like a referee in sports - they must enforce the rules fairly even if they think one team deserves to lose.",1
"why, when intoxicated, does it feel like everything is spinning when you close your eyes but stops spinning when you open them?","When you're intoxicated, alcohol affects your inner ear's balance system. This system uses fluid to tell your brain which way is up. When your eyes are open, your brain can use visual cues to help maintain balance. But when you close your eyes, your brain relies solely on the confused inner ear signals, creating that spinning sensation. It's like trying to balance on a boat - it's easier when you can see the horizon.",1
"Why are some fish bones edible, and others are not?","Fish bone edibility depends on size and composition. Smaller bones, like those in sardines, are softened during cooking and contain beneficial calcium. Larger bones remain hard and can be dangerous to swallow. Think of it like eating a small twig versus trying to eat a tree branch - one is manageable while the other could cause harm.",1
"What's the meaning of the phrase ""I've got a bone to pick with you.""","""Having a bone to pick"" comes from an old analogy comparing a disagreement to a bone that needs to be cleaned or sorted out. Just as a dog might spend time working on a bone, the phrase suggests there's an issue that needs to be addressed or discussed. Today, it means you have a complaint or concern you want to discuss with someone.",1
Why can't we just taste candy or Sweets and then spit it out to avoid its unhealthy attributes? What makes us swallow it to get satisfaction?,"The satisfaction from eating sweets isn't just about taste - it's about your body's reward system. When you swallow calorie-rich foods, your body releases feel-good chemicals as a reward for finding energy-dense food. This system evolved when food was scarce, encouraging us to consume valuable calories when available. Just tasting and spitting wouldn't trigger the same reward response.",1
Why are the things that taste the best bad for us?,"Foods that taste best to us (sweet, fatty, salty) were rare and valuable for our ancestors' survival. Our bodies evolved to crave these high-energy foods because they helped prevent starvation. Today, these foods are easily available, but our bodies still respond to them as if they're rare treasures. It's like having a savings instinct that made sense when banks didn't exist, but causes problems in a world of credit cards.",1
Why do you see weird colors when you press your eyes?,"When you press your eyes, you're physically stimulating the cells in your retina that detect light. These cells normally send signals to your brain when light hits them, but pressure can also trigger them. The random colors you see are your brain interpreting these artificial signals, similar to how pushing on a keyboard randomly creates letters. This is why doctors advise against rubbing your eyes - it can damage these sensitive cells.",1
"If a movie production has $5,000,000 (estimated) Budget, must some of that money go to the actors? or only movie's production quality?","A $5 million movie budget typically covers all production costs, including actor salaries, crew wages, equipment, locations, costumes, special effects, and post-production. Think of it like building a house - you need to pay for materials (equipment, sets), workers (crew), architects (directors), and interior designers (special effects), not just the visible parts. Actor salaries often take a significant portion, but the exact amount varies greatly depending on the actors' fame and the type of movie.",1
What classifies an island as an island? Aren't all continents etc essentially large islands?,"An island is technically a piece of land completely surrounded by water, but continents are different because they sit on their own tectonic plates. Think of continents as the large puzzle pieces making up Earth's surface, while islands are smaller pieces sitting on top of these puzzle pieces. Some exceptions exist (like Greenland, which is considered an island despite its size) based on geological and historical classifications.",1
why does wikipedia ask for donations almost every month? do they really need it to not disappear?,"Wikipedia needs regular donations because running one of the world's most visited websites is expensive. They need to pay for thousands of powerful computers (servers), high-speed internet connections, security systems, and technical staff to keep everything running. It's like maintaining a massive digital library - while the books (articles) are free to read, the building and librarians still need funding. They ask monthly because regular small donations are more reliable than occasional large ones.",1
How does a water purifier jug work and could you put 3rd world ditch water through one and drink safely?,"Basic water purifier jugs usually only filter out contaminants like chlorine, some metals, and particles that affect taste. They can't remove dangerous bacteria or viruses found in untreated water. For unsafe water sources, you need specialized filters or purification systems that can kill microorganisms. It's like using a kitchen strainer versus a medical-grade filter - they serve different purposes and offer different levels of protection.",1
Why people like getting drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced ?,"People drink alcohol for various physiological and social reasons. Alcohol affects brain chemicals that reduce anxiety and increase pleasure. It can temporarily relieve stress and make social interactions feel easier. However, this is a simplified explanation of a complex behavior that can have serious health and social consequences when not managed responsibly.",1
Why has the Mars Rover Opportunity's Lithium Ion Battery Lasted 11+ Years and the one in My Cell Phone/Laptop/Tablet Dies in Less Than 2?,"The Mars Rover's battery lasts longer because it's designed with different priorities. NASA builds batteries focusing on reliability and longevity, not size or cost. They use higher quality materials and protective systems, and the battery isn't used as intensively as phone batteries. Consumer devices prioritize being thin, light, and affordable, which means compromising on battery lifespan. It's like comparing a heavy-duty truck battery to a watch battery - different designs for different needs.",1
Why is sales tax in the US excluded from the list price?,"US sales tax varies by state, county, and sometimes even city. Products are shown without tax because the same item might have different final prices in different locations. A store chain can advertise one price nationwide, and the local tax is added at checkout. It's like how airline tickets show a base fare before adding various local airport fees and taxes.",1
Why does a beer on tap almost always taste better than it does from a bottle?,"Draft beer often tastes better than bottled beer for several reasons. Kegs protect beer from light and oxygen better than bottles, and draft systems are usually cleaned regularly. Bars typically store kegs at ideal temperatures and serve beer fresher. Think of it like the difference between fresh-squeezed juice and bottled juice - the packaging and storage affect the taste.",1
What is the significance of Jamaican Bobsled team qualifies for the Olympics?,"The Jamaican bobsled team's Olympic qualification was significant because it showed how determination can overcome environmental challenges. Jamaica, a tropical country with no snow, managed to compete in a winter sport through dedication and training. Their story inspired the movie ""Cool Runnings"" and represents the Olympic spirit of breaking barriers and pursuing seemingly impossible goals.",1
Is it possible to build up an immunity to poisons both naturally occurring and man-made?,"Building immunity to poisons, called mithridatism, is possible with certain toxins but extremely dangerous. Some snake handlers have built partial immunity to specific venoms through careful exposure. However, many poisons simply accumulate in your body until they reach lethal levels. It's like trying to build immunity to mercury - you can't train your body to handle it, it just keeps building up dangerously.",1
How do devices know the amount of charge left in a battery?,"Devices measure battery charge by monitoring voltage - the electrical pressure in the battery. As a battery discharges, its voltage drops in a predictable pattern. The device tracks this voltage curve and converts it to a percentage. Think of it like measuring water pressure in a tank - as the tank empties, the pressure drops, telling you how much is left.",1
Why are my muscles sore after jumping in cold water?,"Muscles become sore after cold water exposure because of two things. First, your muscles repeatedly contract involuntarily (shiver) to generate heat, similar to a workout. Second, cold causes blood vessels to constrict, potentially reducing blood flow to muscles. When you warm up, blood rushing back into these areas can cause temporary soreness.",1
why do we like watching the same TV show or movie over and over again?,"Rewatching shows provides comfort through familiarity. Our brains enjoy recognizing patterns and knowing what's coming next - it requires less mental energy than processing new information. Also, understanding the full story lets us notice details we missed before. It's like rereading a favorite book - you can focus on appreciating the craftsmanship instead of just following the plot.",1
why do the French have an abstain vote instead of people physically restraining from voting. [Other],"The French abstain vote option lets voters formally express disapproval of all candidates, different from simply not voting. It's like the difference between not attending a meeting versus attending and actively voting ""none of these options."" This helps measure active protest versus apathy and gives voters a way to participate while expressing dissatisfaction.",1
Why The Beatles broke up?,"The Beatles didn't have a dramatic breakup - they gradually drifted apart as they developed different artistic interests and life priorities. Personal relationships became strained, especially regarding business decisions. Each member wanted to pursue individual projects, similar to how close friends might naturally spend less time together as their lives take different directions.",1
- Why do phones not require cooling vents but other small appliances do?,"Phones don't have cooling vents because they're designed to operate at lower power levels than other electronics. They use processors optimized for efficiency rather than raw performance, generating less heat. They also spread heat through their metal cases, using the entire phone body as a heat sink. It's like how a small LED bulb doesn't need a fan but a powerful spotlight does.",1
Why are oil prices so shockingly low?,"Oil prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, production decisions by major oil-producing countries, and global economic conditions. When supply exceeds demand, prices drop. Major producers sometimes increase production to maintain market share, even at lower prices. Think of it like farmers all having a great harvest - more supply than demand leads to lower prices.",1
"If the inside of my microwave is made of metal, why is it bad to put metallic objects in it?","The metal walls of microwaves are specially designed and grounded, safely reflecting microwaves. Loose metal objects like forks can concentrate these waves, causing sparks and dangerous arcing. It's like the difference between a mirror properly mounted on a wall versus broken mirror pieces - one safely reflects light while the other can focus it dangerously.",1
"Why do we lack the instincts our ancestors had, e.g. telling you which foods are poisonous","We haven't lost our ancestral instincts - they've actually adapted to modern life. We still instinctively avoid spoiled food through smell and taste, and we naturally fear certain dangers. The difference is that modern threats (like artificial chemicals) are often undetectable by our ancient warning systems. Our instincts still work, but they're designed for a simpler world with fewer novel threats.",1
Why do we wake up early when we don't have to but tend to wake up late when we need to be up?,"This sleep pattern relates to stress and our body's natural rhythms. When we need to wake up early, anxiety about oversleeping can actually disrupt our sleep. On free days, without that stress, our natural sleep cycle takes over. It's like how you might naturally eat at regular times when relaxed, but stress can disrupt your hunger patterns.",1
"Why do tech/software companies stay in the US when they are demanded to include backdoors by the US government? Can't tech companies just develop and release their products overseas, out of reach of the US government's influence?","Tech companies stay in the US because it's their largest market and leaving wouldn't solve the problem. Other major markets (EU, China, etc.) have similar or stricter requirements. Additionally, the US market is too valuable to abandon - companies would rather fight regulations while maintaining access to US customers, talent, and investors. It's like how a restaurant might dislike local health codes but won't move because that's where their customers are.",1
"with such an important vote like appointing a supreme court nomine, why is the senate floor so empty?","The Senate floor often appears empty because most work happens in offices and committees. Senators spend time meeting constituents, working on legislation, and attending committee meetings. They monitor floor proceedings from their offices and come to vote when needed. It's like a restaurant kitchen - the dining room might look empty, but work is happening behind the scenes.",1
"If you put tires on your car that are larger than the ones from the factory, would you actually be going slower than the reading on your speedometer?","With larger tires, you're actually going faster than your speedometer shows. The speedometer calculates speed based on wheel rotations. Larger tires cover more distance per rotation, so when your speedometer shows 60 mph, you're really going slightly faster. Think of it like measuring distance with walking steps - someone with longer legs covers more ground per step.",1
How does bugspray kills bugs?,"Bug spray typically contains chemicals that attack insects' nervous systems. These chemicals interfere with vital functions like breathing or muscle control. For insects, it's like being exposed to a nerve gas, which is why these sprays are effective at such small doses. This is also why it's important to use bug spray carefully and avoid breathing it.",1
"If a computer has a GPU, why would reducing GUI effects impact performance?","Even with a GPU, some visual effects still use CPU resources for calculations or coordination. Reducing these effects can free up system resources for other tasks. Also, older programs might not be optimized to use the GPU efficiently. It's like having a professional chef (GPU) but still needing kitchen helpers (CPU) to coordinate and prep ingredients.",1
What happens if you don't pay your US Federal income tax?,"Not paying federal income tax has serious consequences. The IRS can seize assets, garnish wages, and even pursue criminal charges for tax evasion. They start with notices and penalties, then escalate to more severe measures. It's like any other debt, but with the full enforcement power of the federal government behind it.",1
Why does my employer require a voided personal check in order to setup direct deposit?,"A voided check provides all the necessary banking information accurately - account number, routing number, and account holder name. It's like a blueprint of your banking details, ensuring the money goes to exactly the right place. Writing mistakes could send your paycheck to the wrong account, so employers want this verified information directly from your bank.",1
Why are the insides of Ovens Dark and Not Metallic or Mirror Like?,"Oven interiors are dark to absorb and distribute heat more effectively. Shiny surfaces would reflect heat unevenly, creating hot spots. Dark surfaces also hide discoloration from normal use better than reflective surfaces. It's similar to how dark asphalt absorbs sunlight better than a reflective surface, helping create even heating.",1
Why does metal react so violently when microwaved?,"Metal in microwaves creates intense electrical fields at sharp edges and points. These fields can become strong enough to cause sparks, like mini lightning bolts. The microwaves excite electrons in the metal so much that they jump through the air. This is dangerous because it can damage the microwave and potentially start fires.",1
How did the American accent come about?,"The American accent didn't ""come about"" - rather, both American and British accents evolved from earlier English. After separation, each region's accent changed independently. The modern British accent developed after American colonization, so neither accent is more ""original."" It's like how siblings might develop different mannerisms after living apart.",1
"Why do The Miranda Rights state that anything you say can ""and will"" be used against you. If something's not incriminating why would it be used against you? Why would cops be forced to admit this up front?","The Miranda warning's ""can and will"" phrase emphasizes that police are not on your side during questioning. Even innocent-seeming statements could be used to build a case against you. It's required to ensure people understand their rights and the serious nature of police questioning. Think of it as a mandatory warning label, like those on medications.",1
Why is it when you rewind VHS tapes they lose their quality over time?,"VHS tapes don't specifically degrade from rewinding. They degrade from physical wear during any playing or rewinding, and from magnetic deterioration over time. The magnetic particles storing the video gradually lose their alignment, like a paper slowly fading in sunlight. Each viewing causes some wear, but time itself is the main factor.",1
"When a new library is built, where do they get their books? I understand many can be bought brand new from publishers. But, what about the old books, or the vast volumes of dated encyclopedias, dated periodicals, etc...","New libraries get books from multiple sources. They purchase new books directly from publishers, but also acquire used books from other libraries, estate sales, and donations. Many libraries belong to networks that share and redistribute books. For reference materials like encyclopedias, they often inherit collections from closing libraries or purchase from specialized dealers. It's like starting a collection - some items are new, some are traded, and some are inherited.",1
"If the ozone layer is made up of O3, why are we not producing some of it ourselves and pumping more of them into the atmosphere to fix the problem faster?","While we can produce ozone (O3), pumping it into the atmosphere isn't practical for several reasons. First, ozone is highly reactive and breaks down quickly at ground level. Second, it's harmful to breathe and can damage plants and materials. The ozone layer naturally forms high in the stratosphere where UV rays convert regular oxygen into ozone. It's like trying to fill a leaky bucket - it's more effective to stop the leaks (reduce harmful emissions) than to keep adding more water.",1
Is it possible to be a 'man without a country'?,"Yes, it's possible to be ""stateless"" or without citizenship to any country. This can happen when someone renounces their citizenship without gaining another, or when countries disagree about who is responsible for someone. Think of citizenship like membership in a club - you can lose your membership, and if no other club accepts you, you're left without belonging anywhere. This creates serious problems since many basic rights and services require citizenship.",1
"In the English language, how are contractions prioritized when a word can belong to two different contractions?","In English, contractions follow a hierarchy based on clarity and common usage. When a word could be part of multiple contractions (like ""I'm"" vs ""I've""), the most commonly used or clearest meaning typically wins. Context usually makes it clear which contraction is intended, similar to how we understand ""bank"" means money or river bank based on context.",1
"The Cuban Missle Crisis and Americas enormous beef with Cuba, what happened there?","The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) was a dangerous standoff between the US and Soviet Union. After the US put missiles in Turkey and supported an invasion attempt of Cuba, the Soviets secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida. When the US discovered this, it created a naval blockade and demanded the missiles' removal. For 13 days, the world faced possible nuclear war until both sides agreed to compromises. This led to decades of tension between the US and Cuba.",1
Why doesn't it rain salt water?,"Rain forms from evaporated water, and only pure water evaporates from the ocean - salt stays behind. When water evaporates, it leaves all minerals and salt molecules behind, like steam rising from a pot of soup leaves the seasonings in the pot. The water vapor then forms clouds and eventually falls as pure water rain.",1
Why can't we use a centrifuge to de-salinate ocean water?,"While we can use centrifuges to separate salt from water, it's not practical for large-scale desalination. The energy cost would be enormous, and the process isn't as efficient as other methods like reverse osmosis. It's like trying to separate sand from water by spinning it - while possible, it's much easier and more efficient to use a filter.",1
What is a MAC Address?,"A MAC (Media Access Control) address is like a device's fingerprint - a unique identification number built into every network-capable device. While IP addresses can change (like moving to a new house), MAC addresses are permanent (like your fingerprints). This helps networks identify and manage different devices, ensuring data goes to the right place.",1
How are adept music players able to just start playing along to anything that someone else plays and have it sound good?,"Musicians who can play along instantly understand music theory and patterns. They recognize common chord progressions and scales, similar to how you can predict the end of common sentences. They've trained their ears to recognize these patterns and their hands to respond automatically, like how you can type without looking at the keyboard after enough practice.",1
Why drill instructor in the army never stop screaming at recruit in the army?,"Drill instructors use constant yelling for several purposes: to create stress that prepares recruits for high-pressure situations, to build instant obedience to commands, and to break down individual habits for rebuilding as a team. It's like resetting a computer - the loud, intense environment helps erase civilian habits and instill military discipline.",1
"if i ground up a piece of pure iron and ate it, would my body abosorb it the same way as iron from food? if not, how do they make iron supplements absorb-able?","Iron supplements are specially formulated to be absorbed by your body. Pure iron powder wouldn't be absorbed well because our bodies need iron in specific chemical forms. Supplement manufacturers create iron compounds that our digestive system can process, similar to how we can't get nutrition from eating raw coffee beans but can from properly processed coffee.",1
Whats is the actual cause of the common itch. and why is scratching it the cure?,"An itch is your body's reaction to irritation, whether from chemicals, light touch, or other stimuli. Scratching temporarily interrupts the nerve signals causing the itch and releases pleasure chemicals in your brain. It's like how pressing a hurt area feels better - you're overwhelming the original sensation with a new one. However, scratching can damage skin and make itching worse long-term.",1
"When popcorn is popping, what is actually happening to the kernel inside?","When popcorn pops, the small amount of water inside the kernel turns to steam when heated. This steam builds pressure until the hard outer shell can't contain it anymore. The sudden release of pressure causes the kernel's starchy interior to expand rapidly and turn inside out, like a tiny edible explosion. The white part is the expanded starch that was previously compressed inside the kernel.",1
What happens to your brain when you space out?,"When you ""space out,"" your brain switches from focused attention to what's called the ""default mode network."" Instead of processing current events, your brain processes memories, makes connections, and sorts information. It's like your brain taking a short break to file away information and daydream, similar to how a computer might run background tasks.",1
What is the point of a Kroger's Shopper card?,"A Kroger's Shopper card is part of a customer loyalty program. It helps the store track purchasing patterns and offer targeted discounts while making customers feel they're getting special prices. The store gains valuable data about shopping habits and can encourage return visits through personalized deals, similar to how a coffee shop might offer a punch card for free drinks.",1
Why haven't our bodies changed to make childbirth less painful?,"Childbirth remains painful because of two evolutionary trade-offs: our large brains require big heads, and walking upright requires a narrow pelvis. These competing demands mean babies must be born before their heads get too large, and must squeeze through a relatively small birth canal. Evolution prioritized these advantages over reducing pain, like choosing a car with better performance despite a rougher ride.",1
American TV shows compared to The rest of the world.,"American TV shows differ from international shows in several key ways. They often have longer seasons (20+ episodes vs 6-12), focus more on advertising breaks, and tend to follow specific formulas. International shows typically have shorter seasons, fewer episodes, and often take more creative risks. Think of it like fast food versus local restaurants - American shows are designed for consistent, reliable entertainment while international shows often experiment more.",1
How do people add colour so accurately to black and white photos?,"Colorizing black and white photos involves detailed research and digital painting. Artists study historical records for accurate colors of clothing, buildings, and objects from that time period. They use specialized software to add colors layer by layer, like painting with digital watercolors. Modern AI tools can help, but skilled artists still need to verify and adjust colors for historical accuracy.",1
How do service animals help autistic children?,"Service animals help autistic children in multiple ways: they provide emotional stability during stressful situations, help maintain routines, and can alert to dangerous behaviors. The animal acts as a constant, calming presence and can be trained to respond to specific needs. It's like having a specially trained best friend who knows exactly how to help when things get overwhelming.",1
"Why do books downloaded from the library need to be ""returned"" after a given amount of time?","Digital library books need to be ""returned"" because libraries can only lend a limited number of copies based on their licensing agreements with publishers. Even though the file isn't physically returned, the license to read it expires so someone else can borrow it. It's similar to how streaming services limit how many people can watch at once.",1
How does Stephen Hawking's speech computer work?,"Stephen Hawking's speech computer worked by tracking his cheek muscle movements using a sensor. He would select letters and words from menus on a screen by twitching his cheek. The computer would then convert his selections into speech. Later versions could predict common words, like how your phone's keyboard suggests words as you type, making communication faster.",1
If a self-driving car detects multiple courses of action (all of which will likely result in human injury) how will it determine which course to take?,"Self-driving cars use programmed ethics to make split-second decisions. They're typically programmed to minimize overall harm while prioritizing passenger safety within legal and ethical bounds. It's similar to how human drivers make quick decisions, but using precise calculations instead of instinct. The exact rules vary by manufacturer and country regulations.",1
why does spicy food make me sweat?,"Spicy food makes you sweat because capsaicin (the compound that makes food spicy) triggers your body's heat sensors. Your body thinks it's actually getting hot and starts its cooling systems, including sweating. It's like setting off a fire alarm - your body responds to the warning signal even though there's no actual fire.",1
"If there are no size regulations regarding goalies in the NHL, why doesn't a team just throw some really obese person out there to block the whole net?","While there's no specific size limit for NHL goalies, extremely large people wouldn't be effective because goalies need to move quickly and precisely. They must be able to drop to the ice, get back up instantly, and move side-to-side rapidly. It's like having a sumo wrestler play soccer - size alone isn't enough when agility and speed are crucial.",1
"If animals aren't aware that they are going to die, why would they try so hard to survive?","Animals don't need to understand death conceptually to have survival instincts. These instincts are hardwired into their brains through evolution - creatures that avoided danger survived to pass on their genes. It's like how you pull your hand away from something hot without thinking about it - it's an automatic response, not a conscious decision.",1
"How can a computer come up with a ""random"" number?","Computers generate ""random"" numbers using complex mathematical formulas and external data like the exact time, system temperature, or user actions. These aren't truly random but are random enough for most purposes. It's like shuffling cards - while the shuffle follows physical laws, it's complex enough to seem random to us.",1
Why are scars near impossible to get rid of?,"Scars are difficult to remove because they're actually a different type of tissue than regular skin. When your body repairs deep damage, it quickly produces tough, fibrous tissue instead of normal skin layers. It's like patching a hole in a wall - the repair might be strong, but it looks different from the original surface and is hard to match perfectly.",1
Why don't developed countries make their own clothing without child labour?,"Developed countries could manufacture clothing domestically, but it would significantly increase costs. The infrastructure, labor laws, and higher wages make local production much more expensive. Companies choose overseas manufacturing to keep prices competitive, like how you might hire a cheaper contractor for home repairs even if a more expensive local one is available.",1
Two spaceships are travelling towards each other at speed of light..,"This is a thought experiment about Einstein's theory of relativity. Two objects can't actually travel toward each other at the speed of light - the combined speed would exceed light speed, which is impossible. Instead, time and space would appear to change for the travelers in complex ways. It's like trying to add two speeds of 100% - you can't get 200%.",1
Why can we eat sushi raw but not other meats?,"We can eat certain fish raw because they have fewer harmful parasites and bacteria that affect humans, and sushi-grade fish is specially prepared and frozen to kill remaining parasites. Other meats typically contain more harmful bacteria throughout the meat. It's like how you can eat raw carrots but not raw potatoes - different foods have different safety profiles.",1
Why is it when oil prices go up gas prices immediately go up but when oil prices come down the price of gas never comes down as fast as when the price of oil increases?,"Gas prices rise quickly with oil prices but fall slowly because gas stations face less competitive pressure to lower prices. When oil prices rise, stations must raise prices to avoid losing money. When oil prices fall, they can gradually lower prices while maintaining higher profits. It's like how stores quickly raise prices during shortages but offer gradual sales rather than immediate price drops when supplies return.",1
"Does time ever end, or is the future infinite?","Whether time ends is one of the biggest questions in physics. Current theories suggest several possibilities: time could continue forever, loop back on itself, or end with the universe's final expansion or collapse. We don't know for certain because we can't observe beyond our current moment. It's like trying to see the end of a road while standing in the middle - we can make educated guesses but can't be sure what's beyond our view.",1
"Why ""crazy people"" have that distinctive look to their eyes","The distinctive look in some mentally ill people's eyes often comes from changes in facial muscle tension, pupil dilation, and blinking patterns caused by their condition or medication. These subtle changes can make their gaze appear unusual to others. It's similar to how you can tell someone is tired by their eyes - the brain's state affects how the eyes appear and move.",1
What is the point of money?,"Money serves three main purposes: it's a medium of exchange (easier than bartering), a store of value (save for later), and a unit of account (measure worth). Instead of trading two chickens for a bag of grain, money lets us assign standard values to things. It's like using points in a game - they represent value and can be exchanged for different things.",1
the hypothetical turtle on an island in the sun question?,"The turtle island question examines how ecosystems influence evolution. If a turtle is alone on an island with abundant food and no predators, would it evolve to be larger and live longer, or would other factors limit its growth? It's like asking what would happen to a character in a video game if you removed all the challenges - would they keep getting stronger or reach natural limits?",1
how does a home equity loan work?,"A home equity loan lets you borrow money using your house's value as collateral. If your house is worth $300,000 and you owe $200,000, you have $100,000 in equity. Banks might let you borrow against this equity, like using your home as a giant credit card. However, if you can't repay, you could lose your house.",1
"In English, what is the rule for the use of “An” or “A”","In English, ""an"" is used before words that start with vowel sounds, while ""a"" is used before consonant sounds. It's about the sound, not the letter - we say ""an hour"" (sounds like ""our"") but ""a university"" (sounds like ""you-niversity""). This makes words flow more smoothly when speaking, like adding oil to hinges to prevent squeaking.",1
Why do we have two small nostrils and not one larger nostril?,"Two nostrils help us smell better and breathe more efficiently. Each nostril takes turns being more open, and they process smells differently due to different airflow rates. It's like having two cameras taking slightly different pictures - the brain combines the information for a better overall picture. Plus, if one gets blocked, you can still breathe through the other.",1
How the heck do authorities determine who started a massive fire in the middle of the woods somewhere?,"Fire investigators look for patterns in burn marks, collect evidence of accelerants, and trace the fire's path back to its origin. They use scientific methods to determine how the fire spread and what caused it, similar to how detectives solve other crimes. They can often tell the difference between natural causes (like lightning) and human-caused fires by examining burn patterns and evidence.",1
How do film/tv productions handle deaths of actors? Examples?,"TV/film productions handle actor deaths in various ways: rewriting scripts, using digital effects, recasting roles, or writing the death into the story. Sometimes they use previously filmed footage or body doubles with digital face replacement. It's like solving a puzzle - they choose the best solution based on the circumstances, available technology, and story needs.",1
What would happen if all the countries wiped all the debt incurred by and owed to each other?,"If all countries suddenly forgave all international debt, it would cause massive economic disruption. Many financial instruments and institutions depend on this debt. It's like removing all the connecting pieces in a giant Jenga tower - while it might seem helpful, the sudden change would likely cause the whole system to collapse. Some countries would benefit, but others would lose valuable assets.",1
Why is it sometimes hard to find something that is right in front of our eyes.,"This phenomenon occurs because our brain filters out familiar information to avoid overwhelming us with data. When actively searching, we sometimes focus too hard on our mental image of what we're looking for and miss the actual object. It's like having a song stuck in your head - you might not hear it playing nearby because your brain is focused on the version in your mind.",1
Why is second day chili better?,"Second-day chili tastes better because the ingredients have more time to interact. Spices continue to release flavors, proteins break down more, and all the ingredients share their flavors more thoroughly. It's like letting tea steep longer - more time allows more flavor to develop and blend together.",1
How does the _URL_0_ door knocking audio clip do such a good job of making it sound like the audio doesn't come from your headphones?,Specialized audio recordings can create directional sound illusions by manipulating how sound reaches each ear. These recordings use precise timing and volume differences to trick your brain into thinking sounds come from specific locations. It's similar to how 3D movies create depth by showing slightly different images to each eye.,1
Computer/TV Screen Size Pricing,"Screen size pricing isn't linear because manufacturing larger screens becomes exponentially more difficult and wasteful. A small defect that might be acceptable on a small screen ruins a large one, and larger screens have higher failure rates during production. It's like making pancakes - bigger ones are harder to make perfect and waste more batter if they tear.",1
"Why do people think Yellowstone will explode and destroy the earth, but not worry about Hawaii's volcano eruption?","People worry more about Yellowstone because it's a supervolcano capable of affecting the entire continent, while Hawaii's volcanoes are regular volcanoes with more localized effects. Yellowstone's eruption would be like comparing a firecracker (Hawaii) to a nuclear bomb (Yellowstone) - they're both explosions, but on vastly different scales.",1
How does cutting down trees to plant other vegetation for the purpose of cultivation (such as avocado farming) contribute to global warming?,"Deforestation for farming affects climate change in multiple ways. Trees store carbon dioxide and release oxygen, so cutting them down releases stored carbon. Additionally, trees help regulate local climate and rainfall patterns. When replaced with crops, the land often stores less carbon. It's like removing a city's air filters while adding more pollution sources - you're both releasing stored pollutants and reducing nature's ability to clean the air.",1
What happens to Lactose when ingested by Lactose-Intolerants?,"When lactose intolerant people consume dairy, their bodies can't break down lactose (milk sugar) because they lack the enzyme lactase. The undigested lactose moves to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas and drawing in water. This causes bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. It's like trying to use a key that doesn't fit - the door won't open, and problems result.",1
"If Helicopters need tail rotors to stabilize themselves from spinning, how can turboprop airplanes have only one rotor and not spin in circles?","Airplanes don't need tail rotors because their propellers don't create the same rotational force as helicopter rotors. Helicopter main rotors create a torque that would spin the helicopter body, requiring the tail rotor to counteract it. Airplane propellers push air straight back, like a fan, without creating significant rotational force.",1
"What is the difference between an air-conditioner and a ""marine"" air conditioner (commonly used on boats)?",Marine air conditioners are built to withstand saltwater exposure and use seawater for cooling instead of air. Regular AC units would quickly corrode in marine environments. Marine units are like regular ACs wearing a waterproof suit and using the ocean as their radiator instead of the air.,1
Why do people bother keeping savings in banks/currencies which are potentially unstable?,"People keep savings in potentially unstable banks because of government insurance programs (like FDIC in the US) and because the alternatives (keeping cash at home) are often riskier. It's like choosing between keeping your valuables in a somewhat shaky safe versus under your mattress - the safe, despite its imperfections, offers better protection.",1
"Why does water freeze from top to bottom? Deep in the ocean it’s below freezing, why doesn’t it freeze?","Water freezes from top to bottom because ice floats - it's less dense than liquid water. The surface water freezes first, insulating deeper water. Deep ocean water stays liquid despite cold temperatures because of pressure and salt content. It's like putting a blanket (ice) on top of a pool - the water underneath stays warmer and liquid.",1
how they catch digital pirates who use hotspots or do they?,"Digital pirates using hotspots can be caught through various methods: tracking IP addresses, monitoring suspicious download patterns, and cooperation between internet providers and law enforcement. However, catching individuals is often difficult and resource-intensive. It's like trying to catch someone wearing a mask in a crowd - possible but challenging.",1
The voting rights of citizens in the District of Columbia historically differ from the rights of citizens in each of the 50 U.S. states. Why can't the U.S. just add an amendment to fix that right now?,Adding a constitutional amendment requires approval from three-fourths of states. Many states are reluctant to give DC equal representation because it would change the balance of power in Congress. It's like asking current players in a game to vote on adding a new player who might change who wins - they might resist even if it's fair.,1
I've been reading up on nukes. Did the Nevada nuclear tests have nuclear winter? Why or why not?,Nevada nuclear tests didn't cause nuclear winter because they weren't powerful enough and didn't create sufficient airborne debris. Nuclear winter requires massive amounts of smoke and debris to block sunlight globally. The Nevada tests were like lighting matches compared to the forest fires needed for nuclear winter.,1
How come cars are able to go up to 220 km/h but highways only allow speeds of up to 110 km/h. Wouldn't it be wiser to have cars max out at 110 km/h-ish and reduce the engine capabilities?,"Cars are built with higher speed capabilities for several reasons: engine efficiency at normal speeds, safety margins for emergencies, and international markets with different speed limits. It's like building a bridge to hold twice the expected weight - the extra capacity provides safety and flexibility.",1
Is it ever possible in the future to have matching finger/thumbprints?,"While it's extremely unlikely for two people to have identical fingerprints, it's theoretically possible in the distant future through random chance. However, the probability is so low it's practically impossible. It's like shuffling multiple decks of cards - theoretically, you could get the exact same shuffle twice, but the odds are astronomical.",1
How a military can overthrow a government?,"Military coups typically occur when armed forces decide to take control from civilian government. They usually need several elements: military unity, weak civilian government, public dissatisfaction, and control of key infrastructure. It's like a hostile corporate takeover, but with weapons instead of stocks.",1
why does spicy food stay spicy when it comes out the other end?,"Spicy food remains spicy during digestion because capsaicin (the spicy compound) doesn't break down in your digestive system. It passes through largely unchanged, irritating tissues along the way. It's like how a piece of sandpaper stays rough no matter how many times you use it.",1
Why do posts on reddit not start on 0 (what's the purpose of allowing one to vote for oneself)?,Reddit posts start at 1 (your own upvote) to encourage participation and prevent posts from being buried immediately. Starting at 0 would mean every post needs someone else's approval to become visible. It's like giving everyone a participation point in a game - it keeps things moving and encourages involvement.,1
How does copyright work with references?,"Copyright with references allows ""fair use"" of copyrighted material for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The amount used and purpose determine if it's fair use. It's like being allowed to quote from a book in a review - you can use parts of it in specific ways but can't copy the whole thing.",1
Why is the word 'cunt' such a taboo word in the U.S.?,"The word ""cunt"" is considered more taboo in the US than in some other English-speaking countries due to cultural and historical differences. In the US, it developed as a specifically misogynistic insult, while in places like Australia and the UK, it evolved into a more general (though still strong) swear word. Cultural taboos often develop differently across regions, like how certain hand gestures mean different things in different countries.",1
Why is the USA drinking age set at 21 when in most other respects you're an adult at 18.,"The US drinking age of 21 was established by the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act, primarily to reduce drunk driving deaths among young people. States were effectively forced to adopt this age by tying it to federal highway funding. It's like parents setting stricter rules than necessary - they'd rather be too cautious than not cautious enough.",1
Why do I not smell perfume I've sprayed on me but other people do?,"You stop smelling your own perfume due to sensory adaptation - your brain filters out constant stimuli to focus on new information. This helped our ancestors detect new threats or opportunities. It's like how you stop noticing the sound of a fan after it's been running for a while, but others entering the room notice it immediately.",1
How does a two headed reptile/siamese twins work? How do they move their bodies assuming there are two brains?,"Two-headed animals typically have two brains controlling different parts of the body, requiring cooperation for movement. Each brain usually controls its side of the body, and they must coordinate for activities like walking. It's like two drivers trying to steer one car - they need to work together to move effectively.",1
"why aren't AK47's an ""accurate"" rifle",AK-47s are less accurate than some rifles because they were designed to be reliable and easy to maintain rather than precise. The loose tolerances that make them work well in harsh conditions also reduce accuracy. It's like comparing a rugged off-road vehicle to a precise sports car - different designs for different priorities.,1
Why can I not remember what happens when I'm drunk?,"Alcohol interferes with your brain's ability to form new memories while intoxicated. Your brain essentially stops recording events properly, like a camera with a failing memory card. You're still experiencing things, but your brain isn't storing the memories correctly for later recall.",1
"Why does having noise in the background (TV, music, etc.) make me feel safer when I'm home alone?","Background noise provides a sense of security because silence makes it easier to be startled by unexpected sounds. Also, familiar sounds can make us feel less alone. It's similar to how prehistoric humans felt safer in groups - background noise simulates the presence of others.",1
Isn't the freshwater we have to work with just going in a cycle? How are we losing fresh water?,"While water does cycle naturally, we're losing accessible freshwater through pollution, overuse of aquifers, and climate change affecting rainfall patterns. It's like having money in a bank - while the same amount might exist somewhere, it's not always accessible when and where we need it.",1
Why is there such a large Insane Clown Posse (Juggalo) following?,The Insane Clown Posse following (Juggalos) grew because they created a strong sense of community among people who felt like outsiders. The band's theatrical style and messages of acceptance attracted people looking for belonging. It's like how sports teams develop devoted fan bases - shared interests create strong social bonds.,1
"Why metal at room temperature feels cold while, say, fabric at room temperature doesn't","Metal feels colder than fabric at room temperature because it conducts heat better, quickly drawing warmth from your hand. Both are the same temperature, but metal removes your body heat faster. It's like touching wet and dry surfaces at the same temperature - the wet one feels colder because it conducts heat better.",1
"A neighborhood cat comes to your home and you feed it. A day/week later, other cats appear at your house looking for food. How did the other cats find out that you're a food giver?","Cats communicate through scent markers and behavioral cues. The first cat likely left scent marks indicating food was available, and other cats detected these signals. It's like how people might notice a new restaurant because they see others eating there - cats have their own way of sharing information about food sources.",1
Why do southern states freak out over a little snow?,"Southern states react strongly to snow because they lack the infrastructure and experience to handle it safely. Without regular snowfall, they don't maintain large fleets of snowplows or salt trucks. It's like asking someone who's never seen rain to drive in a thunderstorm - even a small amount creates significant challenges.",1
"What is the origin and meaning of ""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.""",This quote from Monty Python and the Holy Grail satirizes the concept of divine right to rule. It humorously suggests that random acts (like receiving a sword from a lady in a lake) aren't a logical basis for choosing leaders. It's like saying someone should be CEO because they found a golden ticket in their candy bar.,1
"What are those bastardly little tongue sores you get from eating too much salt or sugar, and how do you get rid of them?","Canker sores (aphthous ulcers) can be triggered by food sensitivities, stress, or minor injuries. They're small ulcers in the mouth's soft tissue that typically heal on their own in 1-2 weeks. While salt and sugar don't directly cause them, they can irritate existing sores. They're like small cuts inside your mouth that take time to heal.",1
Why are swearing words related to genitals and/or sexuality?,"Swear words often relate to taboo subjects because they're designed to shock or express strong emotions. Different cultures consider different things taboo, but bodily functions and sexuality are common themes because they're universal yet private aspects of human life. It's like how forbidden fruits often seem the most tempting.",1
How can Pewdipie make $4M a year?,"PewDiePie earns money through multiple revenue streams: YouTube ad revenue, merchandise sales, sponsorships, and brand deals. With millions of subscribers, even small earnings per view add up significantly. It's like having a stadium full of people each giving you a penny - small amounts from many people become substantial.",1
"Where exactly is a woman's G-spot located, and how do you find it?","The G-spot is located on the front wall of the vagina, about 2-3 inches inside. It's not actually a ""spot"" but rather an area where several sensitive tissues intersect. Finding it varies by individual, as anatomy differs person to person. Due to its location and sensitivity varying among individuals, it's more like finding a light switch in a dimly lit room - the general location is known but exact positioning varies.",1
Why do we hear static from radios and TV's when there's nothing being broadcast? Shouldn't we just hear silence?,"Static on TVs and radios occurs because they're picking up electromagnetic interference from various sources: electrical devices, cosmic radiation, and natural phenomena. Without a clear signal, they detect and amplify this background noise. It's like trying to hear a conversation in a crowded room - when there's no clear voice to focus on, you just hear the general noise.",1
why you can't put metal in the microwave but nothing happens to the metal that it's built from,"The microwave's walls are specially designed and grounded, allowing them to safely reflect microwaves. Loose metal objects can cause dangerous arcing because they're not properly grounded and can concentrate the energy. It's like how a mirror safely reflects light, but a broken piece of mirror can focus it dangerously.",1
The size of the universe.,"The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years across, but the entire universe might be much larger or even infinite. We can only see parts of the universe where light has had time to reach us since the Big Bang. It's like being in the middle of an ocean - you can only see to the horizon, even though the ocean extends much further.",1
Why do school hours not match working hours?,"School hours don't match work hours for historical reasons: schools were originally timed around agricultural schedules, and the modern workday developed separately. Also, shorter school days allow for extracurricular activities and teacher preparation time. It's like having two gears of different sizes - they serve different purposes but don't perfectly align.",1
Why do dogs go absolutely crazy after getting a bath?,"Dogs go crazy after baths for several reasons: relief that the bath is over, trying to dry off, and attempting to restore their natural scent. The bath removes their familiar smell, which can make them feel uncomfortable. It's like how you might feel energized and want to move around after being stuck in one place for a while.",1
What was the warsaw uprising,"The Warsaw Uprising (1944) was a major resistance operation by the Polish Underground against Nazi German occupation. For 63 days, Polish resistance fighters tried to liberate Warsaw before Soviet forces arrived. Despite initial successes, lack of Allied support led to its failure and Warsaw's destruction. It's like a smaller boxer taking on a heavyweight without backup arriving as promised.",1
Why do professional athletes have a significantly lower pulse than the average person ?,Professional athletes have lower resting heart rates because their hearts become stronger through training and can pump more blood with each beat. This means fewer beats are needed to circulate the same amount of blood. It's like having a larger bucket to move water - you need fewer trips to move the same amount.,1
Pirate Bay Megathread,"The Pirate Bay issue involves complex questions about copyright law, internet freedom, and digital rights. The site enables peer-to-peer file sharing but has faced legal challenges for facilitating copyright infringement. It's like a controversial marketplace - while it has legitimate uses, it's often used for unauthorized trading.",1
"How, with the proliferation of free porn websites like youporn, does any porn production make money?","Porn production companies make money through multiple channels: premium content subscriptions, licensing to other distributors, selling data about viewer preferences, and producing custom content. Free sites often serve as advertising for premium content. It's like how free samples at a store can lead to purchased products.",1
How do landlords make money,"Landlords make money through several methods: rental income exceeding mortgage and maintenance costs, property value appreciation, tax benefits, and eventually owning the property outright while continuing to collect rent. It's like owning a vending machine - initial investment and maintenance costs are offset by ongoing revenue.",1
Why do DVDs in widescreen format play with black bars on top and bottom on my widescreen TV,Widescreen DVDs show black bars because movie aspect ratios (width-to-height ratios) often don't exactly match TV screen ratios. The bars ensure you see the whole image without stretching or cropping. It's like trying to fit a long rectangular photo into a more square frame - you need empty space to preserve the original shape.,1
How do spammers spoof a cell phone number to make scam calls?,Scammers spoof phone numbers using technical tricks that fool caller ID systems into displaying fake numbers. They use special software or VoIP services to mask their real numbers. It's like putting on a mask to pretend to be someone else - the appearance changes but the person behind it remains the same.,1
How have wolves impacted Yellowstone?,"Wolves in Yellowstone created a ""trophic cascade"" of environmental changes. They controlled elk populations, which allowed trees and plants to recover, which then provided habitat for other animals and prevented river erosion. It's like removing or adding one piece in a complex machine - the effects ripple throughout the entire system.",1
What is the difference between a CEO and the President of a company?,"A CEO (Chief Executive Officer) is responsible for major company decisions and overall strategy, while the President typically handles day-to-day operations. Sometimes one person holds both titles, but in larger companies, they're often separate roles. Think of it like a ship - the CEO is the admiral choosing the destination, while the President is the captain handling the journey.",1
"Why is it, that when I get really tired, everything is so much funnier?","When you're tired, your brain's inhibition centers become less active, making you more easily amused and less able to suppress emotional responses. It's similar to being slightly drunk - your mental ""filters"" aren't working as well, so things seem funnier than usual. Your judgment of what's funny becomes less discriminating.",1
How do people get infected with plaque?,"People don't get infected with plaque - plaque builds up from bacteria already in your mouth feeding on food particles and producing acid. These bacteria form a biofilm (plaque) on teeth. It's like how soap scum builds up in a shower - it's not an infection, but an accumulation of residue that needs regular cleaning.",1
Why does a company like Boeing need to make a commercial? It's not like anyone watching is going to buy one.,"Boeing advertises to influence public opinion and corporate image, not to sell planes directly. These ads help maintain brand trust, which affects airline purchasing decisions and stock value. It's like a country advertising tourism - they're building a positive image that indirectly influences business decisions.",1
How do American football have bruised lungs without also having broken ribs? Isn't that the point of ribs?,Athletes can get bruised lungs without broken ribs because powerful impacts can damage soft tissue without breaking bones. The force travels through the flexible ribs and damages the lung tissue beneath. It's like how you can bruise an orange without breaking its peel - the impact damages the inside while the outside remains intact.,1
What are dentists actually doing when they scrape at your teeth with those metal picks?,Dentists use picks to remove hardened plaque (tartar) that builds up on teeth. This calcified material can't be removed by regular brushing. The scraping noise comes from breaking this hardened material off the tooth surface. It's like removing barnacles from a boat - they need to be physically scraped away.,1
When did we stop having to type in 'www.'? Why did we have to to begin with?,"Early web browsers required ""www"" to distinguish web addresses from other internet protocols. As the web became dominant, browsers became smarter at recognizing web addresses without it. It's like how we don't need to specify ""telephone:"" before phone numbers anymore - it's now assumed.",1
What is the difference between real and imaginary numbers?,"Real numbers are those you can use to measure things in the physical world (like 1, -2, 3.14). Imaginary numbers are mathematical tools created to solve equations that can't be solved with real numbers alone. They're like invisible helpers that make complex math possible, even though you can't count them with physical objects.",1
How odds work if everything is random?,"Odds work with randomness by measuring probability - the likelihood of different outcomes based on past events or known factors. While individual events are random, patterns emerge over many trials. It's like flipping a coin - each flip is random, but over thousands of flips, you'll see close to 50% heads and 50% tails.",1
How do phones and iPods and such know when they are turned sideways?,"Phones detect orientation using accelerometers - tiny sensors that measure gravity's pull. By sensing which way is ""down,"" the phone knows how it's being held. It's like having a tiny level inside your phone that constantly checks which way is up.",1
"What would be the simplest way to ""unplug"" the internet, causing total shut down by means of disabling hardware?","To ""unplug"" the internet completely would require disabling key infrastructure points called Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), major server centers, and undersea cables. However, the internet's decentralized nature makes total shutdown very difficult. It's like trying to stop water flow in a complex pipeline network - you'd need to block many points simultaneously.",1
The whole Wiki leaks and assange debacle.,"The WikiLeaks situation involves Julian Assange publishing classified documents, raising questions about transparency versus security. The controversy includes issues of journalism protection, government secrecy, and international law. It's like a complex game of chess where every move has multiple consequences affecting different players.",1
"How my wife and kids would go about inheriting things that are only in my name like bank accounts, house, ect..","Estate planning determines how assets transfer after death. Without a will, state laws determine inheritance. Having assets only in your name can complicate things for survivors. It's important to have proper documentation (wills, joint accounts, beneficiary designations) to ensure smooth transfer. Think of it like leaving instructions for accessing a locked safe.",1
What is my all carbs/protein diet doing for me?,An all carbs/protein diet affects your body in specific ways. Carbs provide quick energy but can cause blood sugar spikes. Protein helps build and repair tissues but isn't efficient for energy. Missing fats can affect hormone production and nutrient absorption. It's like running a car on only two types of fuel - you're missing components needed for optimal performance.,1
Are calories just calories? Is it the same if you get a calorie from a fizzy drink or a piece of fruit or a slice of potato or a bit of cheese?,"While a calorie is technically a unit of energy, the source matters for health. Different foods affect blood sugar, hunger, and nutrient levels differently. A calorie from soda provides sugar but no nutrients, while a fruit calorie comes with fiber and vitamins. It's like comparing dollars earned from different jobs - the amount might be the same, but the benefits and long-term effects differ.",1
"Why do computer telephone response systems always ask me to type a bunch of info, then transfer me to a human who asks for the exact same info?","Automated phone systems ask for information twice because they often can't securely transfer data between different departments or systems. Also, verbal confirmation with a human reduces errors. It's like when you tell your story to a nurse and then have to repeat it to the doctor - each system keeps its own records for accountability.",1
"Why is it that lakes/ponds around the world have fairly similar fish, instead of them each having their own unique species of fish like land ecosystems do for animals?","Many lakes and ponds have similar fish because humans have deliberately stocked them over centuries for food and sport. Also, birds can carry fish eggs between water bodies, and waterways were once connected differently during past geological periods. It's like how many cities have similar trees because humans planted them, not because they grew there naturally.",1
How bars or clubs charge huge crowds of people randomly ordering drinks.,"Bars manage large crowds by using systems like running tabs, multiple bartenders, and computerized point-of-sale systems that track orders. Experienced bartenders also memorize common drinks and develop efficient serving patterns. It's like how a busy restaurant kitchen handles multiple orders - through organization, experience, and systems.",1
Why group mentality is so powerful,"Group mentality is powerful because humans evolved as social creatures who needed group survival. We're wired to conform to group behavior and opinions for acceptance and safety. In groups, people often suppress individual judgment in favor of group consensus. It's like how a school of fish moves together - individual fish follow the group for safety.",1
"If each pixel is merely a combination of a red, blue, or green light, why don't colorblind people who can, for example, not see red or green colors, only see blue on computer monitors?","Colorblind people don't just see blue on monitors because the red, green, and blue light combine to create other colors they can perceive, even if they can't distinguish between certain combinations. Their color perception is different, not absent. It's like mixing paints - even if you can't see one color clearly, you can still see the resulting mixture.",1
"The Hateful Eight in 70mm, is there no way to replicate so every theatre gets that ""visual effect""?","70mm film provides unique visual quality that digital can't perfectly replicate because it captures light differently. While digital can approximate the look, the physical properties of film create subtle effects that are hard to reproduce. It's like how a vinyl record has a different quality than a digital music file.",1
How does a watch know when a month has 30 or 31 days?,Modern watches use programmed calendars that account for different month lengths. Mechanical watches often require manual adjustment for months with fewer than 31 days. More sophisticated watches have perpetual calendars programmed with month lengths and leap years. It's like having a tiny calendar computer inside the watch.,1
Why does tiredness feel as though it comes in waves?,"Tiredness comes in waves because your body's sleep pressure (desire to sleep) interacts with your circadian rhythm (internal clock). When these cycles align, you feel very tired; when they oppose each other, you feel more awake. It's like waves in the ocean - they get bigger when multiple waves combine.",1
how does your brain produce a coloured image through staring at a negative?,"Your brain produces colored afterimages because staring at an image fatigues certain color-sensing cells in your retina. When you look away, the non-fatigued cells respond more strongly, creating an opposite-colored image. It's like pressing on your skin - when you release, you feel the opposite sensation.",1
"Why are most passwords hidden on-screen by default when you type them, but WIFI passwords are not?",WiFi passwords are usually visible when typing because they're often shared and entered in semi-public settings. Regular passwords are hidden for security since they're meant to be private. It's like having your house number visible but keeping your safe combination hidden.,1
Why does time use the number 60?,"Time uses base-60 because of ancient Babylonian mathematics. They chose 60 because it's easily divisible by many numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30). This system was useful for astronomy and everyday calculations, and it stuck around. It's like how we still use dozen (12) for some measurements - old systems persist when they're practical.",1
The true difference between i5 and i7 processors,"The main difference between i5 and i7 processors is that i7s typically have more cores, larger cache memory, and can handle more simultaneous tasks (threads). i7s are generally better for heavy multitasking and intensive applications, while i5s are good for everyday use. Think of i5 as a four-lane highway and i7 as a six-lane highway - both work, but one handles more traffic.",1
Why does water taste bitter after eating pineapples?,"Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain that breaks down proteins, including those on your tongue. After eating pineapple, water can taste bitter because your taste buds are temporarily affected by this enzyme. It's like how spicy food can make everything else taste different for a while.",1
how a drug goes from needing a prescription to being able to buy it without a prescription,"A drug typically moves from prescription to over-the-counter when it has a long safety record, manageable side effects, and clear usage instructions. This process involves extensive FDA review and often takes years. It's like how a new driver eventually gets an unrestricted license after proving they can drive safely.",1
How do cars calculate speed and preview it on the speedometer?,Cars calculate speed by measuring how fast the wheels are turning using sensors. The car's computer knows the wheel size and can calculate distance traveled per rotation. Modern cars also use GPS and other sensors for accuracy. It's like counting how many times a bicycle wheel spins to figure out how fast you're going.,1
What would happen if we could drill a hole to the core of the Earth?,"If we could drill to Earth's core (which we can't due to heat and pressure), the hole would collapse long before reaching it. If it somehow stayed open, anything dropped would fall to the center and bounce back and forth due to gravity. It's like trying to dig through a pressurized water balloon - the forces involved make it impossible.",1
Is there a psychological term for when you finish a game/book/series and feel empty inside?,"The empty feeling after finishing a good book or series is called ""post-series depression"" or ""book hangover."" It happens because you've emotionally invested in a world and characters that suddenly end. Your brain needs time to readjust to reality. It's like saying goodbye to friends after a long vacation.",1
"Why is it, that even though I genuinely love Whiskey, I shudder nearly every time I drink some?","Shuddering while drinking whiskey is a natural response to strong alcohol. The burning sensation triggers a protective reflex, even when you enjoy the taste. It's similar to how your eyes might water when cutting onions even though you like onions - it's an automatic body response.",1
Why is it when I drink a glass of liquid I urinate at least twice as much back out?,"You urinate more liquid than you drink because your body produces extra water as it breaks down food and stored energy. Also, you release water that was already in your body. It's like squeezing a wet sponge - the water coming out isn't just what you just added, but what was already there.",1
What prevents DNA from getting tangled?,"DNA stays untangled thanks to special proteins called topoisomerases that act like molecular scissors and reorganizers. These proteins cut, untwist, and reconnect DNA strands to prevent knots. It's like having tiny maintenance workers constantly organizing a giant ball of string.",1
Why does the tray in a microwave rotate?,"Microwave trays rotate to distribute heat more evenly. Microwaves have hot and cold spots, and rotation helps food pass through these spots for more even cooking. It's like rotating a plant to give all sides equal sunlight - the movement ensures more uniform exposure.",1
why child support is based on income rather than what a child would need monthly.,Child support is based on income because it aims to maintain the child's standard of living relative to their parents' abilities. The idea is that children should benefit from their parents' success. It's like splitting a restaurant bill based on each person's salary rather than equally - those who can afford more pay more.,1
"If you had a room with all walls, the floor, and the ceiling made of perfect mirrors and you shined a light in there somehow, would the light continue in there forever? Would it somehow disappear?","In a perfect mirror room, light would bounce around for a very long time but not forever. Even the best mirrors absorb some light with each reflection. Eventually, the light would be absorbed completely. It's like bouncing a ball - even on a perfect court, it eventually stops due to tiny energy losses.",1
It seems like the whole world is against George Lucas' remade and remastered version of the Original Star Wars trilogy. What exactly did he do to change the story that makes fans hate it so much? Why all the vitriol?,"George Lucas's Star Wars changes upset fans because they altered iconic scenes and character moments from the original trilogy. Many felt these changes undermined the original films' charm and meaning. It's like someone repainting parts of a classic painting - even if well done, it changes what made it special.",1
How do blankets work? Why do they allow me to become warm even when the outside is cold?,Blankets work by trapping a layer of air between you and the outside environment. This air is warmed by your body heat and acts as insulation. The blanket also blocks air movement that would carry away warm air. It's like how a thermos keeps coffee hot - by creating a barrier that prevents heat escape.,1
"Why does the media spend so much time covering the question of whether or not Jeb Bush can rise in the polls, but doesn't extend nearly that level of coverage to other non popular contestants?","Media coverage of political candidates often follows ratings and viewer interest rather than equal coverage principles. If more people are interested in a particular candidate's chances, media outlets will cover them more to attract viewers. It's like how stores stock more of what sells well - they respond to consumer demand rather than giving equal shelf space to all products.",1
The different between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims.,"Sunni and Shia Muslims differ primarily in their beliefs about who should have led the Muslim community after Prophet Muhammad's death. Sunnis believe leadership should have been decided by consensus, while Shias believe it should have passed through Muhammad's family line. It's like how a company might dispute whether new leadership should be chosen by board vote or family succession.",1
Why did film become a synonym for movies when photography also used film?,"""Film"" became synonymous with movies because early motion pictures were the most popular and visible use of film technology. While photography also used film, cinema's cultural impact made ""film"" primarily associated with movies. It's like how ""phone"" means mobile phone now, even though landlines still exist.",1
The core beliefs of American political parties.,"American political parties have evolved to represent different approaches to government. Democrats typically favor more government programs and regulations, while Republicans generally support less government intervention and lower taxes. However, these positions are complex and change over time. It's like two different approaches to managing a household - one might prefer more structured rules while the other emphasizes individual responsibility.",1
How do broadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports when they don't know how many commercial breaks there will be?,Sports broadcasters maximize advertising revenue through careful planning and flexible scheduling. They have predetermined commercial break points (like timeouts) but can also adjust to game flow. They sell different ad slots at different prices based on likely viewership. It's like street vendors who know when crowds will be highest and adjust their prices accordingly.,1
"Why when we are sick/have an infection does our body temperature go up, as in a fever?",Fever is your body's defense mechanism against infection. Higher temperature makes it harder for many harmful organisms to survive and helps your immune system work more effectively. It's like turning up the heat to drive out unwanted pests - uncomfortable but effective as a defense strategy.,1
Why do real almonds not taste like almond paste/flavoring?,"Real almonds don't taste like almond flavoring because the flavoring (benzaldehyde) comes from bitter almonds, a different variety than eating almonds. Commercial almond flavoring is usually synthetic. It's like how grape-flavored candy doesn't taste like real grapes - it's based on a different compound than what gives grapes their taste.",1
Why haven't people as a whole adapted to the cold? We have adpated to the sun by the pigment in our skin changing colour depending on your exposure to sunlight.,"Humans haven't fully adapted to cold because our technology (clothing, heating) has reduced the selective pressure for cold adaptation. We've used our intelligence to create artificial warmth instead of biological adaptation. It's like how we use cars instead of evolving to run faster - technology provides an easier solution than biological change.",1
"When I swallow a pill, why is there sometimes a heavy feeling in the back of my throat?","Pills can create a heavy feeling in your throat because they may stick slightly to the esophagus wall, especially if not taken with enough water. The sensation can last even after the pill has passed. It's like how a sticky note might leave a feeling on your finger even after it's gone - the sensation persists.",1
"Why is Reddit valued at ""only"" ~$1.8 billion, when less popular sites (e.g. Twitter) are worth many times more?","Reddit's lower valuation compared to Twitter reflects different business models and monetization potential. While Reddit has many users, its community-focused structure makes it harder to monetize than Twitter's more advertisement-friendly format. It's like comparing a public park to a shopping mall - both have visitors, but one is easier to make money from.",1
How can there be a sex wage gap in the US if we've had the Equal Pay Law since 1960?,"The wage gap persists despite equal pay laws because of various complex factors: career choices, negotiation differences, family responsibilities affecting work hours, and subtle workplace biases. Laws can mandate equal pay for equal work, but can't address all these underlying factors. It's like having rules that everyone can climb a ladder, but some people start on different rungs or face different obstacles.",1
How can electric motors for cars be small enough to fit into a car and relatively cheap while industrial electric motors with similar power and torque are the size of a kitchen and cost more than an electric car?,Car electric motors can be smaller because they're designed differently from industrial motors. Car motors are optimized for high-speed operation and can be cooled more effectively due to their design and the car's movement. Industrial motors often need to handle constant heavy loads and variable speeds. It's like comparing a marathon runner to a weightlifter - different designs for different purposes.,1
"Why are sunglasses universally considered ""cool""?","Sunglasses are considered cool for several reasons: they create mystery by hiding the eyes, they're associated with celebrities (who wear them to avoid photographers), and they often make faces appear more symmetrical. They've become a symbol of sophistication through cultural associations. It's like how a suit makes someone look professional - it's a cultural symbol that's evolved over time.",1
What is the difference between quality sushi and regular sushi?,"Quality sushi differs from regular sushi in several ways: fresher fish, better rice preparation, skilled knife work, and balanced proportions. High-end sushi chefs train for years to perfect these elements. It's like comparing a fast-food burger to one made by a skilled chef - same basic ingredients but very different preparation and quality.",1
Why do American cities often have to take large public transport projects such as light rail and metro system to the voters but don't have to do the same for massive highway and road construction?,"Public transport projects often require voter approval because they typically need new taxes or bonds for funding, while road construction usually comes from existing budgets and gas taxes. Also, public transport represents a bigger change to how people travel. It's like needing roommate approval to buy new furniture but not to repair existing furniture.",1
How come bluetooth is so much slower than Wi-Fi?,"Bluetooth is slower than Wi-Fi because it's designed for different purposes. Bluetooth prioritizes low power consumption and quick, easy connections between devices over speed. Wi-Fi focuses on high-speed data transfer at the cost of more power use. It's like comparing a bicycle to a car - each has advantages for different situations.",1
How does the ISS avoid damage from solar wind's if it is always in constant orbit?,"The ISS is protected from solar wind by Earth's magnetic field, which deflects most harmful particles. The station also has special shielding for additional protection. It's like having both an umbrella (Earth's magnetic field) and a raincoat (shielding) for protection from rain.",1
Why do we tear up when we yawn,We tear up when yawning because yawning stretches facial muscles that can compress tear ducts and stimulate tear production. It's also connected to facial nerve stimulation during the yawn. It's like how squeezing a water balloon makes water come out - the physical pressure causes the release.,1
"With the Separation of Pangea, how come we didn't evolve into several different species?","Pangea's separation didn't lead to completely different human species because: 1) it happened long before humans existed, 2) humans have always found ways to travel and mix populations, and 3) the time since human dispersal hasn't been long enough for complete speciation. It's like how different breeds of dogs are still all one species - separation hasn't been long or complete enough for true species divergence.",1
How is Canadian healthcare different from Obamacare?,"Canadian healthcare differs from Obamacare in that it's a single-payer system where the government pays for most healthcare services. Everyone is automatically covered through taxes. Obamacare, instead, regulates private insurance and helps people buy it. It's like comparing a public library (Canadian system) to a regulated bookstore with subsidized prices (Obamacare).",1
Why do app developers like supercell release their updates/apps way earlier on one platform than the other?,"App developers often release updates on different platforms at different times for several reasons: different approval processes (Apple's App Store is usually stricter than Google Play), testing on specific platforms first to catch issues, and managing server loads. It's like rolling out a new product in different stores - doing it gradually helps manage potential problems.",1
"Why do the vast majority of good police officers and other form of L.E. protect the ""bad apples"" and not outcast/ help remove them?","Police officers often protect ""bad apples"" due to several factors: strong cultural emphasis on loyalty and unity, fear of retaliation or being labeled a ""snitch,"" and concern about losing support in dangerous situations. It's similar to how siblings might not tell on each other even when one does something wrong - group loyalty can override individual judgment.",1
"If we were still at war with Nazi Germany, Nazi supporters would be tried for treason. Why now are Nazi groups aloud to persist, unchallenged by law?","Nazi groups are allowed to exist in the US because of First Amendment protections of free speech and assembly. Unlike during wartime, when supporting an enemy nation is treason, holding extremist views alone isn't illegal unless it leads to specific criminal acts. It's like how having bad ideas isn't illegal, but acting on them to harm others is.",1
Why is pencil graphite referred to as Lead instead of graphite?,"Graphite is called ""lead"" in pencils because ancient Romans used actual lead for writing. When graphite was discovered to be better for writing, people kept using the old term, even though it's incorrect. It's like how we still ""dial"" phone numbers even though phones don't have dials anymore.",1
"Why are the words ""Yeah"" and ""Oh"" always in pop songs and said for so long?","""Yeah"" and ""Oh"" are common in pop songs because they're universal sounds that work across languages and help create emotional connection. They're also easy to sing and can fill musical space naturally. Think of them like musical seasoning - they enhance the song without changing its main ingredients.",1
"Where does color goes when the sun ""bleaches"" it?","When sun bleaches color, it's breaking down the chemical bonds in dye molecules that create color. The color doesn't go anywhere - it's destroyed, like how a photograph fades when left in sunlight. The molecules are still there, but they no longer reflect light in ways that create color.",1
Why does my phone echo sometimes?,"Phone echo happens when there's a delay between your voice and its return through the phone system. This can happen due to network delays or when your phone's speaker sound gets picked up by its microphone. It's like hearing your voice bounce back from a canyon, but with electronic signals instead of sound waves.",1
Why does inbreeding cause the offspring to have a significantly lower IQ than average? What is the science behind it?,"Inbreeding leads to lower IQ because it increases the chance of harmful genetic traits being expressed. When closely related people have children, genetic problems that were hidden can become active. It's like having backup copies of a computer file - with inbreeding, you lose the backups and are stuck with any errors in the main file.",1
"Why is it that after waking from a bad dream, even though I am awake and aware that the dream was not real, I am still irrationally freaked out and disturbed by the events of the dream for a good amount of time?","Dreams feel real because they activate the same emotional centers in your brain as real experiences. When you wake up, these emotional responses don't immediately shut off, even though your logical mind knows it was just a dream. It's like how you might still feel scared after watching a horror movie, even though you know it's not real.",1
Why can't modern houses be economically independent with solar + battery+ a little backup generator just incase?,"Houses aren't commonly independent with solar and batteries because of high initial costs, varying energy needs, and technical limitations of current battery technology. While it's possible, the investment needed for complete independence is often too high for most homeowners. It's like wanting to grow all your own food - possible but expensive and complicated to implement.",1
"If we are 70% H2O, why are we considered Carbon based?","We're carbon-based because carbon forms the basic structure of all our molecules, even though water is the most abundant compound. It's like how a house is ""wood-based"" even though it might contain more air by volume - the carbon provides the essential framework for life.",1
Why do we have speed limits rather than a speed range?,"Speed limits rather than ranges exist because they're simpler to enforce and understand. A minimum speed might encourage people to drive faster than conditions safely allow. It's like having a ""don't run"" rule instead of a ""walk between 2-4 mph"" rule - simpler to follow and enforce.",1
"can you explain the NFL lockout to me (what it is, why it happened, outcomes of it etc.) LI5","The NFL lockout was a work stoppage when team owners and players couldn't agree on how to share the league's revenue. Owners wanted players to take less money, while players wanted to maintain their share and improve safety measures. It's like when parents argue over how to divide the family budget - both sides have different priorities and needs.",1
The world can't agree on standard units of measurement for anything except time. H ow come?,"Time measurements are standardized globally because ancient civilizations divided days similarly based on observable sun patterns, and modern global commerce made it essential to coordinate time worldwide. Other measurements varied by culture and local needs before standardization attempts. It's like how everyone agrees on dividing a day into 24 hours, but different cultures traditionally used different ways to measure distance.",1
We all mostly skip or block ads. What makes companies still believe online ads like on youtube is worth investing?,"Companies invest in online ads because even though many people block them, enough people still see and click them to make them profitable. They can also track exactly how many people interact with ads, making it easier to calculate return on investment. It's like how stores still send out junk mail - even a small response rate can make it worthwhile.",1
Can someone explain what quantum suicide and quantum immortality are?,"Quantum suicide and immortality are thought experiments based on quantum mechanics. They suggest that in a scenario where quantum events determine life or death, from your perspective you might only experience outcomes where you survive, while other observers might see you die. It's like having infinite parallel stories, but you only experience the ones where you continue living.",1
"Why is it that plants comparatively much less diverse (only ~250,000 species) than other clades of life?","Plants have fewer species than animals because they generally adapt to their environment rather than moving to new ones, reproduce more slowly, and often can hybridize between species. Also, being stationary means they face fewer diverse challenges than mobile animals. It's like having fewer varieties of houses than cars because houses don't need to adapt to different movement challenges.",1
Why do we randomly get this weird/burning sensation in the nose when inhaling?,"The burning sensation in your nose when inhaling happens when nerve endings in your nasal passages are irritated by temperature changes, chemicals in the air, or pressure changes. These sensations help protect your respiratory system. It's like having a sensitive alarm system that warns you about potentially harmful substances.",1
how do sinkholes happen,"Sinkholes form when underground water erodes soft rock (like limestone) beneath the surface, creating cavities that eventually collapse. It's like how a sandcastle might suddenly collapse if waves wash away the sand underneath - the surface looks stable until the support beneath gives way.",1
"Are mobile ads intentionally the last thing to load while opening a page, so more people would accidentally click them?","Mobile ads often load last because advertisers want them in the most noticeable positions, and websites prioritize loading content first. Sometimes this placement is intentional to increase accidental clicks. It's like putting the impulse purchase items near the checkout counter in a store - placement affects interaction.",1
why are we producing more aluminium than we recycle if it takes 95 percent less energy to recycle?,"We produce more new aluminum than we recycle because: demand keeps growing, collection systems aren't efficient everywhere, and some aluminum products are designed for single use. Even though recycling uses less energy, the system isn't optimized for maximum recycling. It's like having a library where it's easier to buy new books than return old ones.",1
why are there no comedy categories at the Oscars,"The Oscars lack comedy categories because comedy is often considered less prestigious and more subjective than drama in Western culture. Also, many comedic performances include dramatic elements, making categorization difficult. It's like how comfort food rarely wins fine dining awards, even though it's just as important to cuisine.",1
"Why is it when I love someone a lot, that sometimes I have to hug them tightly and it feels like I can't be close enough.","The urge to hug tightly comes from the release of oxytocin, often called the ""bonding hormone."" This chemical creates a desire for physical closeness and can make us feel like we want to be even closer to someone we love. It's like how a warm blanket feels good, but sometimes you want to wrap it even tighter.",1
Why are the stairs of an escalator higher than the stairs of a staircase?,Escalator steps are taller than regular stairs because they need space for the mechanical components that move the steps. The height also helps maintain a continuous flow of movement. It's like how a conveyor belt needs to be thicker than a regular belt to hold its machinery.,1
Why does half and half in containers not have to be refrigerated? How come it can be left out for days while milk has to always be kept cold?,"Shelf-stable half and half undergoes ultra-high temperature processing and is packaged in sterile containers, while regular milk typically undergoes less intensive processing. Once opened, both need refrigeration. It's like how canned soup stays good on a shelf but needs refrigeration after opening.",1
Why are smoke shops allowed to sell bongs?,"Smoke shops can legally sell bongs because they're marketed as tobacco accessories or ""for tobacco use only."" The items themselves aren't illegal - it's how they're used that might be illegal. It's like how a hardware store can sell pipes that could be used for plumbing or other purposes.",1
How does hot water work in hotels?,"Hotels use large central boilers and circulation systems to maintain hot water supply. The systems constantly heat and circulate water through the building, ensuring availability at all times. It's like having a giant kettle that's always keeping water hot for whenever someone needs it.",1
How do pornography sites stay in business?,"Pornography sites stay in business through multiple revenue streams: advertising (especially targeted ads), premium subscriptions, selling user data, affiliate marketing with other adult sites, and partnerships with adult entertainment companies. Free content acts as a ""teaser"" to attract users who might pay for premium features. It's like how free mobile games make money through ads and optional premium features.",1
"How am I a W-2 employee, yet do not qualify for any benefits, including unemployment? Details in comments.","W-2 employees might not qualify for benefits if they work part-time, are temporary, or fall under specific exemptions in labor laws. Employment classification doesn't automatically guarantee benefits. It's like being a member of a club but not qualifying for all member privileges.",1
How come Humans can't learn animal languages and communicate to them?,"Humans can't easily learn animal languages because they evolved differently from human language. Animals communicate through specific signals for specific situations, while human language can create infinite new meanings by combining words. It's like how traffic lights can communicate basic messages but can't tell complex stories.",1
"How and Why exactly does encryption work? Dont you need to transfer the key, and couldnt (lets say the NSA) not simply obtain it by saving all your internet activity?","Think of encryption like having a special box with two different locks. When you want to send a secret message to your friend on the internet, your friend gives you their ""public lock"" that anyone can use to lock messages. This lock is special because even if someone like the NSA sees it, they can't use it to unlock the box - only your friend has the matching ""private key"" that can open it.",1
What do degrees (temperature) actually measure?,"Temperature degrees are like a measure of how jumpy atoms are. When something is hot, its atoms are bouncing around like excited kids at a playground. When it's cold, they move slowly like sleepy kids. Temperature measures how fast these atoms are moving and bumping into each other.",1
Why is it such a big deal that it costs more than 1 cent to make a penny? Shouldn't the cost and production of other coins and bills counteract the defecit of making pennies?,"Making pennies for more than they're worth is like buying $1 cookies for $1.50 each to sell them for $1 - you lose money on every single one. While other coins do make a profit, the huge number of pennies made each year means we're still losing a lot of money overall. It's like losing $5 on each penny cookie but making $2 on each quarter cookie - you're still losing money if you make way more penny cookies.",1
Why does yellow mustard taste so different from Dijon mustard?,"Yellow mustard and Dijon are made from different types of mustard seeds. Yellow mustard uses mild yellow seeds and includes turmeric (which makes it yellow), while Dijon uses stronger brown seeds and white wine. It's like comparing mild bell peppers to spicier jalapeños - they're related but taste very different!",1
Why are denim jeans both stiflingly uncomfortable in hot weather and freezing in cold weather?,"Denim jeans are uncomfortable because they're made from thick, tightly-woven cotton that doesn't breathe well. In summer, this tight weave traps heat and sweat. In winter, the cotton gets cold and stays cold because it holds onto moisture from the air or your body. It's like wearing a thick blanket that gets sweaty when hot and stays wet when cold.",1
the oligodynamic effect (i.e brass doorknobs disinfecting themselves after a period of time),"The oligodynamic effect is like having a superhero doorknob! Metals like brass and copper naturally kill germs that land on them. It's similar to how soap kills germs on your hands, but the doorknob does it by itself over time.",1
"I am short-sighted. If I look in a mirror which is close to my face, objects in the distance (in the mirror) still look blurry. Why?","When you're short-sighted, your eyes can't focus on far things. A mirror doesn't fix this - it's just showing you a reflection of those far things. It's like taking a blurry photo and looking at it up close - the photo will still be blurry!",1
How do hair transplants work?,Hair transplants work like moving plants from one garden to another. Doctors take hair follicles (tiny hair-growing spots) from areas with lots of hair (usually the back of your head) and carefully plant them where you want new hair to grow. The transplanted hair then grows in its new spot!,1
Do water filters (like those placed in Brita water pitchers) really make a substantial difference in the quality of the water?,"Water filters do make a real difference! They work like a super-fine strainer that catches tiny bits of dirt, chemicals, and other yucky stuff. While tap water is usually safe, filters can make it taste and smell better by removing things like chlorine (what makes pool water smell funny).",1
Why some people would rather help an animal than a human?,Some people prefer helping animals because animals seem more innocent and can't help themselves like humans can. It's like choosing to help a baby who can't speak or ask for help versus helping an adult who might be able to find other ways to get help.,1
Why are second (and if lucky) third orgasms in a sex session (with a partner or alone) less intense than the first?,"Your body gets tired, and your brain runs out of the ""feel-good chemicals"" it pumped out during the first orgasm. So, the second or third is like riding the same rollercoaster again—not as thrilling because it’s not brand new anymore!Air pressure in houses is like invisible bubbles of air pushing against things. When you close a door:",1
"Air pressure in houses? Why do some doors hit a cushion of air when they close, some doors slam when they close, and some doors get sucked closed?","Air pressure in houses is like invisible bubbles of air pushing against things. When you close a door:If it hits a ""cushion,"" the room's air is trapped and has to squeeze out slowly.If it slams, there's nothing stopping the air from moving. If it gets sucked closed, it's like a vacuum pulling it shut because air is flowing to another part of the house",1
Why do such well-known companies as McDonald's and Coca-Cola pay tens of millions to be the lead sponsors of the World Cup/Olympics/etc.? Do people really not know these companies at this point?,Big companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola sponsor big events for the same reason your local pizza place might sponsor a school event - to remind people they exist and make them feel good about the brand. It's like waving to your friends at a party so they remember you're there and think you're cool!,1
The number system of Graphics Cards,"Graphics card numbers are like grades in school. Higher numbers usually mean better performance. The first number tells you which generation (like which grade), and the other numbers tell you how powerful it is within that generation (like your score in that grade).",1
"Why can I hear a TV from another room, even if the volume is off?","When you think a TV is off but hear sound, it's usually because sound travels through walls better than you might think. It's like how you can hear someone talking in the next room even with the door closed - sound waves can bounce around and travel through materials.",1
"What does ""single payer"" mean in the american health care system ?","Single-payer healthcare is like having one big piggy bank (run by the government) that everyone puts money into through taxes, and when anyone needs to go to the doctor or hospital, this piggy bank pays for it - just like how your parents might have one family credit card that pays for everyone's needs.",1
How is mass extinction humans fault?,"Humans are causing mass extinction like a really messy kid in a playground who keeps breaking toys, making the space dirty, and taking up all the room so other kids can't play - we're cutting down forests, polluting the air and water, and taking up so much space that many animals and plants can't survive anymore.",1
"How are branded drinks mass produced? (Gatorade, Monster)","Branded drinks are made in huge factories that are like giant kitchen mixers - they combine water, flavoring, sugar, and other ingredients in massive tanks, making thousands of bottles at once using the exact same recipe each time to make sure every drink tastes the same, just like how your mom might use the same recipe every time she makes cookies.",1
what's an API? (computers),"An API is like a restaurant menu - it tells other computer programs exactly what they can order (or request) and how to ask for it, so different programs can work together without knowing how each other's kitchens (internal workings) actually prepare the food.",1
Why are Japanese fan content creators so much more strict about their activities in order to avoid copyright issues than Western fan creators?,"Japanese creators are like kids following strict playground rules because their parents (laws) are very strict about borrowing other kids' toys (copyrighted material), while Western creators are like kids on a playground with more relaxed parents who don't mind as much if they share and modify each other's toys.",1
The difference between a parody and a satire,"A parody is like copying your friend's funny dance moves to make people laugh, while satire is like acting silly to show everyone that your friend's dance moves aren't as cool as they think - parody makes fun of the style, while satire makes fun of the meaning behind it.",1
"How come—when looking at the light produced on earth VIA satellite imagery, they are always yellow, when in fact, there are lights of all different colors being produced?","Satellite photos show city lights as yellow because they're taking pictures from very far away, and when all the different colored lights blend together from that distance, they look yellow - just like how when you mix all your paint colors together, they make a muddy brown-yellow color.",1
"Why is insurance handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government?","Insurance is handled by private companies instead of the government because America likes to let companies compete to give people choices, like having many different ice cream shops instead of just one government ice cream store - the idea is that competition will make companies try harder to make customers happy.",1
How do tunnel builders know where they are going?,"Tunnel builders know where they're going because they use special tools like a GPS for underground, measuring exactly where they are like following a map in a straight line - they also dig from both ends and use math and lasers to make sure they meet in the middle, just like when you and a friend dig toward each other in a sandbox.",1
How exactly do Saline pools work?,"Saline pools work like putting salt in your bath water - instead of using chlorine (the strong-smelling stuff in regular pools), they use special machines to turn regular salt into a cleaner that keeps the water safe to swim in, kind of like how your body uses salt to keep germs away.",1
"Why did I just pay $250 for a passport with a 3-week turnaround, when a driver's license is $25 and take 30 minutes?","A passport is much more expensive and takes longer because it's like making a super-special ID card that works in every country - it needs special security features, checks from multiple government offices, and has to be much harder to fake than a driver's license, just like how a house key is more complicated and expensive than a simple toy key.",1

How do coffee machines (like a Keurig) super heat water in 10 seconds?,"Keurig machines don't actually super-heat water in 10 seconds - instead, they keep a reservoir of hot water ready all the time. When you press brew, the machine pumps this already-hot water through the K-cup. It's like having a pot of hot water always ready on the stove rather than heating it up each time you want tea.",1
"When you boil water, where does the air that fills the bubbles come from?","When water boils, the bubbles are actually filled with water vapor, not air. As the water gets hot enough, some of it turns into steam (water in gas form). These steam bubbles rise up through the liquid water and pop at the surface. It's similar to how a puddle disappears on a hot day - the water turns into vapor, but just much faster when boiling.",1
"... If yogurt is made with a starter of a small bit of yogurt, how was the first yogurt ever created?","The first yogurt was likely discovered by accident when milk was stored in warm conditions in animal skin bags containing natural bacteria.

How do you hurt your opponent without hurting yourself?,"Headbutting works because the forehead is the hardest part of the skull, and when done properly, the force is directed through the thick frontal bone while the target gets hit with a smaller, more concentrated impact. It's like using a hammer (your forehead) to hit a nail (the target) - the force is focused on a small point for maximum effect.",1
Most fracking happens at over 1 to 2 miles under ground. What is the theory that explains how that water gets through 2 miles of bedrock to pollute my 150 foot well?,"Fracking critics argue that the high-pressure injection of fluids can create or widen cracks in rock layers, potentially creating pathways for contaminated water to reach shallow aquifers. While the fracking itself happens deep underground, the concern is about these new pathways connecting different layers of rock and water sources over time.",1
"How do planes ""break"" the sound barrier?","Planes don't actually ""break"" anything - they pass through the compression waves of sound they create.

It's like a boat creating a wake in water, but with invisible sound waves in the air.",1
"How can ""The Interview"" have an all persons fictitious disclaimer at the end, when it is clearly based on a real living person?","Movies can use the ""all persons fictitious"" disclaimer even when portraying real people because it's a legal protection against defamation claims. Even though everyone knows who the character represents, the disclaimer helps protect the filmmakers by claiming any similarities to real people are coincidental. It's like wearing a seatbelt - it's protection against potential legal problems.",1
Why did Longswords give way to rapiers and sabres during the Renaissance?,"Longswords gave way to rapiers and sabers because warfare changed and society became more urban. As heavy armor became less common and close-quarters combat in cities increased, lighter, faster weapons became more practical. It's like switching from heavy winter boots to running shoes when the weather gets warmer - the tool changed to match the new conditions.",1
Is a human virgin birth scientifically possible?,"A human virgin birth (parthenogenesis) is theoretically impossible in humans because we need genetic material from both male and female to create viable offspring. Unlike some animals that can reproduce this way, humans require genetic diversity from two parents to develop properly. It's like trying to bake a cake with only half the necessary ingredients - it just won't work.",1
How does Piratebay still manage to be a live website?,"The Pirate Bay stays alive through a combination of constantly changing server locations, mirror sites, and decentralized hosting. When one server gets shut down, they quickly switch to another, making it hard to stop completely. It's like playing whack-a-mole - when one location gets blocked, they pop up somewhere else.",1

It's like having millions of tiny bullets shooting through your cells, causing damage faster than your body can fix it.",1
Why is a baby not nine months old when its born?,"A baby isn't nine months old at birth because pregnancy timing starts from the mother's last period, about two weeks before conception. Plus, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks (closer to 9.5 months), with those first two weeks counting before the baby exists. So a newborn has only been developing for about 38 weeks, or 8.5 months - like starting a race timer before runners reach the starting line.",1
what in our brain makes the auto alarm clock go off?,"Our brain's internal clock (circadian rhythm) works by tracking time using light and temperature.

Why is it that Reddit only displays some of my subreddits in the drop down at one time?,"Reddit's dropdown menu has a character limit to prevent it from becoming too long and unwieldy. Instead of showing all subscribed subreddits at once, it displays a random selection that changes periodically. This design choice helps manage the interface for users who follow many subreddits while still providing access to their full subscription list through other menus.",1
How and why did cannabis come to be illegal?,"Cannabis became illegal in the 1930s through a combination of racism, industry lobbying, and moral panic. Hemp threatened timber and paper industries, while anti-Mexican sentiment and fear-mongering about marijuana's effects led to the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. The War on Drugs in the 1970s further criminalized it, despite limited scientific evidence supporting these policies.",1
Why is female handwriting generally distinguishable from male handwriting?,"Female handwriting tends to differ from male handwriting due to a combination of social conditioning and fine motor skill development.

It's like watching a 3D movie - two slightly different images combine to create one complete picture with depth.",1
Why does semen turn hard when exposed to hot water?,"Semen contains proteins that coagulate when exposed to heat, similar to how egg whites harden when cooked. This happens because the heat causes the proteins to change shape and stick together, forming solid clumps. Cold water, however, doesn't trigger this reaction, which is why cooler water is better for cleaning.cleaned = re.sub(r'^\d+:\s*', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)",1
LI5: Why wont the US government legalize marijuana?,"The US hasn't legalized marijuana federally due to historical politics, lobbying, and bureaucracy.

Despite growing public support and state-level legalization, federal change moves slowly.",1
Why did Tipper Gore get so much hate from the music industry and fans during 1985 for wanting parental guidelines on music?,"Tipper Gore faced backlash for leading the Parents Music Resource Center, which pushed for warning labels on albums with explicit content.

"Why in construction, when they lay rebar, is it in a grid pattern?","Construction uses rebar in grid patterns because it strengthens concrete in multiple directions. The grid distributes weight and stress evenly, preventing cracks and collapse under pressure. Think of it like weaving fabric - the criss-crossing threads make it much stronger than parallel threads alone would be.",1
Why do Wind turbines have three blades?,"Wind turbines have three blades because this design provides the optimal balance between efficiency, stability, and cost. Two blades would be unstable and create stress on the turbine, while four or more blades would add weight and cost without significant power gains. Three blades also allow smooth rotation and even distribution of force across the hub.",1
Why does diarrhea make your anus burn.,"Diarrhea burns because it contains digestive enzymes and acids that normally get neutralized during digestion. When food moves too quickly through your system, these harsh substances don't get properly processed and can irritate the sensitive skin around the anus. The frequent wiping and acidic content create inflammation and that burning sensation.",1
What is the purpose of hanging highly irradiated patient's limbs up in the air?,"Heavily irradiated limbs are elevated to reduce swelling and fluid buildup caused by radiation damage. This positioning helps improve circulation and lymphatic drainage, similar to elevating a sprained ankle. The elevated position also helps minimize tissue damage and promotes healing by reducing pressure on affected areas.",1
How is the melody encoded on a vinyl and how is it reproduced by a record player ?,"Vinyl records store sound in microscopic grooves carved into the plastic. The groove's wiggles match the original sound waves - one side controls left-right movement, the other up-down. When playing, the needle follows these grooves, converting physical movements back into electrical signals that become sound through speakers.",1
Why can we multiply by 0 but not divide by 0.,Multiplying by zero makes sense because you're taking zero groups of something - giving you zero. But dividing by zero is impossible because you can't split something into zero equal parts. It's like trying to share 10 cookies among zero friends - there's no way to do it that gives a sensible answer.,1
How did child rearing work before diapers?,"Before modern diapers, cultures used various natural materials like leaves, animal skins, or cloth to catch baby waste. Babies were often wrapped loosely in fabric and frequently changed. Some societies practiced ""elimination communication"" - learning babies' signs for needing to go and holding them over designated spots. Natural materials were washed or disposed of, though hygiene standards were lower.",1
"When naming a new royal, are there only certain names they are allowed to use or is it just assumed they'll use a previous royal name?","Royal names aren't legally restricted, but tradition strongly influences choices. Names typically honor past royals or family members, establishing continuity and historical connections. The choices also consider public perception and cultural significance. While modern royals have more flexibility, they generally select names that reflect dignity and heritage of the monarchy.",1
"According to the BBC: pilots used the aircrafts' sensors to confirm ""no civilians were in the proximity of the targets"" In the Syrian Bombings. How?","Military aircraft use various sensors including infrared cameras, radar, and high-resolution imaging to detect human presence near targets. These systems can distinguish between civilian and military structures by analyzing heat signatures, movement patterns, and building characteristics. Multiple confirmation methods help minimize civilian casualties during military operations.",1
Why do dogs throw up when they're hungry?,"Dogs often vomit when very hungry because excess stomach acid and bile build up without food to digest. This irritates their stomach lining, causing nausea and vomiting yellow bile. It's called 'hunger puking' or 'bilious vomiting syndrome,' and feeding smaller, more frequent meals usually prevents it.",1
"Why is the Holocaust remembered as such a tragedy, while the Japanese invasion of China (with similar casualties) is almost forgotten?","The Holocaust's extensive documentation, Western focus, and continuous memorialization efforts keep it prominent in global memory. While the Japanese invasion of China was similarly devastating, factors like language barriers, political complications between China and Japan, and less systematic documentation have led to less widespread awareness outside Asia.",1
How did Enigma cracking machine know it cracked Enigma?,"The Enigma cracking machine used statistics to identify successful decryption. German messages followed specific patterns and always ended with certain phrases. When the machine found text with proper German language patterns and expected military phrases, it knew it had cracked the code. It's like solving a puzzle - you know you're right when the pieces fit and form a clear picture.",1
Why do Americans always cheer when they hear their hometown/state?,"Americans cheer for hometowns due to strong local identity culture and pride in regional connections. This stems from the country's size and diversity, where people often identify strongly with their local community. The tradition is reinforced through sports, media, and social practices that celebrate hometown connections as shared experiences.",1
Why does building a robot like the mars rover cost so much money?,"Mars rovers cost billions because they need unique, highly reliable components that work in extreme conditions without repair options. Each part requires extensive testing, custom manufacturing, and redundant systems. The development process includes years of research, testing, and specialized engineering to ensure success in Mars' harsh environment.",1
What's the difference between Meth and Adderall?,"Adderall and meth share a similar chemical structure as both are amphetamines, but Adderall is pharmaceutical-grade, precisely dosed, and less potent. Meth is more concentrated, often impure, and creates a stronger, more dangerous effect on the brain. While both affect dopamine systems, meth's higher potency and impurities make it significantly more dangerous.",1
Why can't we use physical tests to detect mental illness?,"Mental illnesses can't be physically tested yet because they involve complex brain chemistry and neural connections we don't fully understand. While we can see some brain structure differences through scanning, mental health involves subtle chemical balances, environmental factors, and personal experiences that current technology can't measure precisely or consistently.",1
"What makes the japanese market so different from the western one? Why japan has all these special edition albums, games, mangas, electronics, gadgets that are never released elsewhere?","The Japanese market differs due to unique consumer preferences, business practices, and cultural values. Companies create special editions because Japanese consumers value novelty, limited items, and regional variations. The market is often seen as a testing ground for new products, and companies maintain Japan-specific lineups due to different technological standards, language needs, and cultural tastes.",1
What makes debts you owe be removed / halved in what you originally owe from Debt Collectors?,"Debt collectors often reduce debts because they buy them for pennies on the dollar from original creditors. They profit even with significant reductions and prefer getting some payment over none. The age of debt, statute of limitations, and likelihood of collection all influence their willingness to settle for less.",1
What are trust funds and how do they work?,"Trust funds are legal arrangements where assets are held and managed by trustees for beneficiaries. The creator (grantor) sets rules for how money is distributed, often to protect assets or ensure responsible use. Like a special bank account with conditions - maybe you can only withdraw for college or after reaching certain age milestones.",1
"Why do certain ""noises"" (i.e., a fingernail scratching a chalkboard) irritate us so much?","Certain sounds irritate us because they share frequencies with predator calls or human distress signals that our brains evolved to find alarming. These sounds, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 Hz, trigger our autonomic nervous system's fight-or-flight response. The screech of chalk particularly bothers us because it hits these sensitive frequencies.",1
"What is the purpose of electric motion detecting hand towel dispensers in public restrooms when we have cheap, mechanical, spring loaded dispensers which have no circuitry and always work?","Electric dispensers were introduced as ""more hygienic"" since you don't touch them, but they're often less reliable and more expensive than mechanical ones. While marketed as an upgrade, they frequently malfunction and require battery changes. The complexity doesn't justify the minimal hygiene benefit over simple mechanical dispensers.",1
Why are programs allowed to use 100% CPU ?,"Programs can use 100% CPU because the operating system trusts applications to manage their own resources. While this can cause system slowdowns, restricting CPU usage could prevent programs from completing intensive tasks when needed. The OS provides tools to manage priority and resource allocation rather than imposing strict limits.",1
why do bombs and missiles explode in the air above their target? Instead of hitting the ground/target and exploding?,"Air-burst explosives are often more effective because they spread damage over a wider area and can overcome obstacles or fortifications. When a bomb explodes above ground, its blast waves can reach targets that would be protected from a ground explosion. The shock wave reflects off the ground, creating a more destructive combined pressure effect.",1
"Besides cannabis, are there any objects that naturally contain THC?","THC naturally occurs only in cannabis plants, including hemp varieties. While some other plants contain compounds that interact with the same brain receptors, true THC is unique to cannabis. Other plants sometimes rumored to contain THC, like chocolate or hops, actually contain different compounds that may have mild similar effects.",1
Why do people puke when they over-exert themselves?,"Over-exertion causes vomiting when intense exercise redirects blood flow from digestive organs to muscles. This reduced blood flow to the stomach, combined with stress hormones and motion, can trigger nausea. The body also releases compounds during extreme exercise that can stimulate the vomiting center in the brain.",1
The Russian military's current capabilities,"Russia's military capabilities include significant conventional forces, nuclear arsenal, and cyber warfare units, but recent conflicts revealed logistical weaknesses and outdated equipment issues. While maintaining large numbers of personnel and equipment, challenges with modernization, maintenance, and professional training have impacted overall effectiveness.",1
How do G force suits work?,"G-force suits help pilots avoid blackouts during high-speed maneuvers by using air bladders that automatically inflate around the legs and abdomen. When experiencing high G-forces, these inflated bladders squeeze blood upward toward the brain, preventing blood from pooling in the lower body and maintaining consciousness at high acceleration.",1
How does fostering kids work?,"Foster care provides temporary homes for children whose parents can't care for them. Foster parents undergo training, background checks, and home inspections, then receive support for the child's needs. Children may return to birth parents, move to permanent adoption, or stay in foster care depending on their situation and court decisions.",1
"The different ""grades"" of gas, and how much it really matters.","Gas grades differ in octane ratings - regular (87), midgrade (89), and premium (91-93). Higher octane prevents engine knocking in high-performance engines by controlling fuel ignition timing. Most modern cars run fine on regular gas, only requiring premium if specifically designed for it or when towing/hauling heavy loads.",1
Why did they need to close the airspace over Sydney because of the current hostage situation?,"Airspace closure during hostage situations creates a safety buffer zone, preventing media helicopters or drones from interfering with police operations. This keeps tactical information from being broadcast live and ensures emergency helicopters can operate safely if needed.",1
What are the potential health risks to humans of pervasive plastic contamination?,"Plastic contamination risks include hormone disruption, cancer, reproductive issues, and immune system problems. Microplastics enter our bodies through food, water, and air, accumulating in organs and bloodstream. Research suggests they may also carry harmful chemicals and attract toxins, though long-term effects aren't fully understood.",1
"Why is stock only traded 6hrs/day, 30hrs/week?","Stock market hours are limited to create organized trading, allow time for analysis and processing, and maintain market stability. The concentrated trading window helps establish fair prices through higher liquidity and allows after-hours analysis of market movements. Extended hours would increase volatility and strain market systems.",1
"do workout supplements (such as pre-workout that claims to increase the ability of your blood to deliver oxygen to muscles) actually work, and if so what actually happens to your body?","Many workout supplements work through various mechanisms - caffeine boosts energy, creatine helps muscle energy production, and amino acids aid recovery. However, effectiveness varies greatly between products and individuals. Some ingredients have solid scientific backing, while others rely more on marketing than evidence.",1
What causes stains to become permanent?,"Stains become permanent when they chemically bond with fabric fibers or cause permanent color changes. Time, heat, and washing can set stains by driving particles deeper into fibers or triggering chemical reactions. Some stains also physically damage fabric structure, making removal impossible without damaging the material.",1
"If sound is typically vibration travelling through air, how can I hear someone through a wall.","Sound travels through walls because sound waves can vibrate solid materials. The waves hit the wall, causing it to vibrate and create new sound waves on the other side. While some sound energy is absorbed or reflected, enough passes through to be audible, especially lower frequencies.",1
Why does bacon sometimes get that green shimmer?,"Bacon's green sheen comes from a chemical reaction when meat proteins break down and combine with nitrites used in curing. This creates an iridescent effect similar to how oil spots show rainbow colors. While unappetizing, this chemical reaction is harmless and doesn't indicate spoilage.",1
"Why do we pronounce ""colonel"" as ""curnel/kernal?""","""Colonel"" is pronounced ""kernel"" due to language evolution. The word came from Italian ""colonello"" through French ""coronel."" English adopted both spellings, but kept the French pronunciation. Over time, ""colonel"" became the standard spelling while the pronunciation remained from the French influence.",1
Karl Marx's Manifesto,"Marx's Communist Manifesto outlines how capitalism creates class struggle between workers and owners. It argues that workers (proletariat) will eventually overthrow the wealthy (bourgeoisie) to create a classless society. The manifesto calls for abolishing private property, shared resources, and worker control of production.",1
Why is it that people from the United States call themselves American when they aren't the only country located on the north and south continents?,"Americans took the term because the United States was the first independent nation in the Americas to use ""America"" in its name. While technically imprecise, the term became standard through historical usage, global recognition, and lack of a better alternative (""United Statesian"" never caught on).",1
"Why am I ""Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law"", but only found ""not guilty"" and not ""innocent""?","Courts find defendants ""not guilty"" rather than ""innocent"" because trials determine if there's enough evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The system doesn't prove innocence - it decides if prosecution proved guilt. Like science, it's easier to prove something false than prove absolute truth.",1
Why is reading good for the brain?,"Reading benefits the brain by creating new neural connections, improving memory, and enhancing cognitive functions. It increases vocabulary, strengthens focus, reduces stress, and builds empathy through experiencing different perspectives. The brain treats reading as a complex workout, strengthening multiple mental skills simultaneously.",1
What is revisionist history and why is it bad?,"Revisionist history reinterprets past events by selectively emphasizing certain facts while ignoring others, often to support a particular agenda or ideology. It's problematic because it distorts historical understanding and can be used to justify harmful policies or beliefs. Unlike legitimate historical reexamination with new evidence, revisionism typically starts with a desired conclusion and works backward.",1
"Why do we call Earths moon ""The Moon"", when every other moon in the solar system have their own separate name?","Earth's moon got its simple name ""the Moon"" because it was the only moon humans knew about for most of history. When Galileo discovered Jupiter's moons in 1610, we started naming other moons specifically. ""The Moon"" stuck for Earth's satellite because it was the original reference point, just like we call our star ""the Sun.""",1
Why and how is the middle east in such chaos in the past decades?,"Middle East instability stems from multiple factors: artificial borders drawn after WWI ignoring ethnic and religious groups, competition for oil resources, religious conflicts, foreign intervention, and power struggles between regional powers. Cold War politics, authoritarian governments, and ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict further complicate the situation.",1
Why is it my jaw (below the ear) hurts after I blow up a balloon that's tough to inflate?,"The jaw pain comes from straining the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) near your ear. When blowing up balloons, you clench these muscles and joints hard to create pressure. It's similar to how your muscles might ache after any strenuous exercise - you're essentially giving your jaw muscles an intense workout.",1
How did Seth Bling manage this code injection in Super Mario World?,"Seth Bling used a complex technique called arbitrary code execution in Super Mario World. By precisely arranging items and player actions, he manipulated the game's memory to inject new code. The game treats certain memory locations as both data and instructions, so carefully placed items can make the game execute custom programming. It's like writing a new recipe into a cookbook by rearranging existing ingredients.",1
"Why is it Creationists disbelieve in evolution? More so, is there something in the bible that disputes evolution? Could God not have ""created"" evolution?","Some creationists reject evolution due to literal Bible interpretation, particularly Genesis creation story. However, many religious people accept ""theistic evolution"" - the idea that God used evolution as a mechanism for creation. The conflict often stems from interpretation rather than direct Biblical contradiction, as evolution wasn't a concept when the Bible was written.",1
Why are the republican/democrat debates called debates? There's hardly any debating going on.,"Modern political debates are structured more like parallel interviews or campaign speeches than traditional debates. Real debate involves direct engagement, counter-arguments, and structured discussion of specific points. Today's format prioritizes sound bites and talking points over actual debate, focusing on appealing to viewers rather than engaging opponents' arguments.",1
How come I'm not related to people that have the same last name as me?,"Last names often aren't reliable indicators of relation because they spread through various means besides family ties. Surnames came from occupations, locations, or patronymics, and many people historically shared common last names without relation. Additionally, names changed through immigration, adoption, marriage, or choice.",1
"If you melt a penny or rip up a dollar, are you combating inflation, since that cash is no longer in circulation? or is inflation less straightforward?","Destroying currency doesn't combat inflation because modern money supply isn't primarily physical cash. Most money exists digitally in bank accounts. When physical money is destroyed, central banks simply print replacements. Inflation relates to total money supply and economic factors, not just physical currency in circulation.",1
I've read that quantum computers can easily break all our current security protocols. How do they do this?,"Quantum computers could break current encryption by quickly factoring large numbers - a task classical computers find extremely difficult. While normal computers try combinations sequentially, quantum computers use quantum properties to test many possibilities simultaneously. However, we're developing new ""quantum-resistant"" encryption methods that even quantum computers couldn't easily crack.",1
"Why is it called the ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" when it's not a democracy or a republic?","North Korea uses ""Democratic People's Republic"" despite being a dictatorship because authoritarian regimes often adopt democratic-sounding names to appear legitimate. Similar to how the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) wasn't democratic, it's an attempt to claim popular authority while maintaining autocratic control. The name serves propaganda purposes rather than describing actual governance.",1
How does a computer screen work?,"Computer screens work by combining tiny red, green, and blue lights (pixels) to create images. LCD screens use liquid crystals that twist to control light passing through colored filters, while LED screens directly emit colored light. Each pixel can change brightness independently, creating millions of color combinations to form pictures.",1
"How come the suit (pants, shirt, jacket, tie) became the norm for formal dressing everywhere and not something else?","The modern business suit became standard formal wear during Britain's Industrial Revolution, spreading through European colonialism and business influence. The style projected wealth and professionalism, while being practical for cooler climates. Global trade and Western cultural dominance in the 19th-20th centuries made it the international business standard.",1
Student Loan Default and its consequences?,"Student loan default damages credit scores, preventing home buying and major purchases. The government can garnish wages, tax refunds, and Social Security benefits. Unlike other debts, student loans rarely discharge in bankruptcy. Default can also block future education funding and some job opportunities, creating long-lasting financial consequences.",1
"Why do many companies nowadays see tattoos as being ""unprofessional""?","Corporate tattoo policies stem from historical associations with counterculture and concerns about customer reactions. Despite changing social attitudes, many businesses maintain conservative appearance standards believing they project professionalism. However, policies are becoming more flexible as tattoos gain mainstream acceptance and companies prioritize talent over appearance.",1
"Sleep deprivation - If you have a sleepless night and then proceed to get the recommended 7.5 hours of sleep the following days, for how long will you be in a sleep deprivation?","One sleepless night creates sleep debt that takes multiple nights of good sleep to repay. While you might feel better after one recovery night, research shows it takes about 4-5 days of proper sleep to fully restore cognitive function and repair physiological effects of sleep deprivation.",1
Why is cheese such a big deal to the French?,"Cheese significance in French culture developed through centuries of regional cheesemaking traditions, monastery preservation techniques, and geographical diversity enabling unique varieties. France's climate and terrain supported dairy farming, while cultural emphasis on gastronomy elevated cheese to an art form representing local identity and culinary excellence.",1
"instead of fighting green energy, why don't coal and gas companies invest in it?","Traditional energy companies resist green transition due to existing infrastructure investments, shareholder pressure for immediate profits, and technical expertise tied to fossil fuels. While some diversify into renewables, complete transition requires expensive restructuring and risks losing competitive advantages in their current market.",1
What exactly is sous-vide? Isn't it just boiling the food?,"Sous-vide cooking uses precise temperature control by sealing food in plastic and immersing it in temperature-regulated water. Unlike boiling, which uses high heat, sous-vide maintains exact temperatures (often much lower) for perfect doneness. This preserves flavors and ensures even cooking throughout.",1
Why are some medications race-based?,"Race-based medications exist because genetic variations between populations can affect drug metabolism and effectiveness. These differences influence how quickly drugs break down or how well they bind to targets in the body. While controversial, considering genetic heritage can help optimize treatment effectiveness.",1
How does Publix (a grocery chain in the SE United States) make a profit when they offer so many buy one-get one (BOGO) deals?,"Publix profits through careful pricing strategy, making margins on non-BOGO items and using deals to drive traffic. They negotiate vendor support for promotions, maintain efficient operations, and build customer loyalty. BOGOs attract shoppers who then buy other higher-margin products.",1
Why do many large companies lease their office/retail space instead of owning it?,"Large companies lease space for financial flexibility, tax advantages, and reduced capital investment. Leasing allows easier relocation, doesn't tie up money in real estate, and provides tax-deductible expenses. Companies can invest capital in core business operations rather than property maintenance.",1
"If Muhammad was ""just"" a prophet, then why do Muslims treat his persona at a level above what modern Christians treat Jesus Christ?","Muslims revere Muhammad highly because he's seen as the final prophet who received direct divine revelation through the Quran. While not considered divine like Jesus in Christianity, his life serves as the perfect example of religious practice. His teachings and actions form essential religious law and guidance.",1
Why do we clap for celebration?,"Clapping evolved as a universal celebration signal because it's loud, visible, and contagious. The sharp sound attracts attention and synchronizes group emotion, while the physical act releases tension and energy. It's an instinctive way to show approval that's easily recognized across cultures.",1
"How do you ""get"" depression? Do things that make life miserable alter the chemicals in our brains, are certain people more likely to be depressed?","Depression develops through a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Brain chemistry changes when exposed to chronic stress, trauma, or other negative experiences, affecting neurotransmitters like serotonin. Some people are more vulnerable due to genetics, but life events can trigger depression in anyone through physical changes in brain function.",1
How can people function on only a few hours of sleep?,"Short sleepers survive by entering deep sleep stages more quickly and having genetic variations that allow more efficient sleep. However, most people claiming to function on little sleep are actually chronically sleep-deprived, compensating through caffeine and suffering health consequences.",1
"Why is general anaesthesia so common for wisdom teeth removal, if it isn't necessary?","General anesthesia for wisdom teeth is common in the US due to patient preference, dental practice business models, and cultural expectations. While local anesthesia works well, many choose full sedation to avoid anxiety and discomfort. Insurance coverage and dental office setups often promote this option.",1
Most of my money is a number in a bank database. What is there to stop a bank artificially inflating someone's number?,"Banks face multiple safeguards against number manipulation: government audits, internal controls, digital security systems, and transaction records across multiple institutions. Like a shared accounting book, every transaction leaves traces that must match across different banks and regulatory systems.",1
How can people with Down's Syndrome donate blood,"People with Down Syndrome can donate blood because their condition affects chromosomes, not blood composition. Their blood is just as safe and useful as anyone else's, provided they meet standard health requirements for donation. The extra chromosome doesn't impact blood safety or function.",1
Why is Morrissey so popular amongst Latinos?,"Morrissey's popularity among Latinos stems from his emotional lyrics, dramatic performance style, and themes of outsider identity that resonate with immigrant experiences. His music's emphasis on romance, melancholy, and social alienation particularly connects with Mexican cultural traditions of emotional expression.",1
What do physicists mean when they say space is curved?,"When physicists say space is curved, they mean gravity warps the fabric of spacetime like a heavy ball on a stretched sheet. This curvature affects how objects move through space and time, creating what we experience as gravity. It's not visible curvature in 3D space, but in the 4D structure of spacetime.",1
Why do problems and stresses that don't seem like a big deal during the day suddenly seem life threatening and world ending when you wake up at 2:30 AM?,"Nighttime worries feel worse because reduced distractions allow anxious thoughts to dominate. Darkness triggers primitive survival instincts, while lower cortisol and higher melatonin levels can affect emotional regulation. The quiet and isolation can make problems seem more overwhelming.",1
"Why do we just ""click"" with some people?","People ""click"" due to matching communication styles, shared values, and compatible personality traits. Neurological synchronization occurs when people share similar thought patterns and reactions. This natural chemistry creates instant rapport through unconscious recognition of similarities.",1
How are mathematicians and astronomers able to predict solar and lunar eclipses thousands of years in advance?,"Astronomers predict eclipses using mathematical models of celestial bodies' orbits. These calculations account for gravitational effects, orbital mechanics, and historical patterns. Computer programs process this data to project future positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth with remarkable accuracy.",1
Why do people's voices get super deep/groggy in the mornings?,"Morning voice deepness comes from fluid accumulation in vocal cords during sleep and reduced muscle tension. Lying flat allows fluid buildup, while lack of use makes vocal muscles less toned. This temporary change resolves as you move around and use your voice.",1
"If every blood donation is screened for HIV, why is it dangerous to let a group with a higher rate of HIV donate blood?","Blood screening has limitations in detecting recent HIV infections due to a ""window period"" when the virus is present but undetectable. Higher-risk groups could donate during this period, potentially passing HIV despite screening. Statistically restricting high-risk groups reduces overall transmission risk.",1
"What is actually going on inside your body when you ""get the wind knocked out of you""?","Getting ""winded"" happens when a blow forces your diaphragm to spasm, temporarily disrupting normal breathing rhythm. This muscle contraction prevents normal inhaling until the spasm releases. The frightening sensation comes from your body's panic response to interrupted breathing pattern.",1
How can Libertarians oppose the militarization of police forces yet ardently support the 2nd Amendment?,"Libertarians view these positions as consistent with limiting government power. Supporting gun rights promotes individual autonomy, while opposing police militarization resists state authority. Both stances aim to prevent government overreach, though from different angles.",1
Why don't they package soda and beer the same? Like why do we have 30 racks of beer and not soda?,Beer packaging differs from soda due to different consumption patterns and marketing strategies. Beer's social drinking culture and higher price point support larger bulk purchases. Soda's lower cost and everyday consumption patterns favor smaller quantities and individual servings.,1
Why is it that I visit websites and Facebook/Google automatically know that and give me targeted ads?,"Websites use tracking cookies, pixels, and scripts to monitor your browsing. When you visit sites, these tools record your activity and share data with advertising networks. Companies then use this information to show ads related to your interests and browsing history.",1
Why do flies keep on landing on the same spot after scaring them away,"Flies repeatedly land in the same spot because they identify favorable locations through smell and visual markers. They remember safe spots with food sources or suitable landing surfaces. Like having a favorite chair, flies return to places they've found comfortable.",1
"Was there ever a ""wood age""?What do we know about wooden(and other perishable) tools?","A ""wood age"" existed throughout human prehistory alongside stone tools. Archaeological evidence shows sophisticated wooden tools and structures, but most decayed. Rare preserved examples from bogs and permafrost reveal complex woodworking predating metal use.",1
Why are death row inmates housed separately?,"Death row inmates are isolated for security, to prevent violence, and to enable closer monitoring. Their separate housing reflects both their high-risk status and the special procedures surrounding execution. The isolation also serves as additional punishment and control measure.",1
How does the National Security Council differ from other federal agencies?,"The National Security Council directly advises the president on security and foreign policy, unlike other agencies that implement policy. It coordinates between military, intelligence, and diplomatic departments to provide comprehensive security recommendations and crisis management.",1
What are transcendental equations,"Transcendental equations contain functions like trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic terms that can't be solved using basic algebra. They require special techniques or numerical methods because you can't isolate the variable through normal equation solving steps.",1
Why do we capitalise all words except conjunctions and some prepositions in titles?,"Title capitalization rules evolved from typography traditions, aiming to highlight important words while keeping articles and short connecting words lowercase. This makes titles more readable by emphasizing content words. The convention was standardized by style guides and publishing practices.",1
Why are crickets so hard to find?,"Crickets seem hard to find because they're expert hiders, using camouflage and quick reactions. Their directional sound production confuses predators about their location. They also stop chirping when sensing danger and can quickly hop away from threats.",1
How does machine learning work? Do computers experience cognitive dissonance where they have to weigh two conflicting ideas?,"Machine learning works by finding patterns in data and adjusting mathematical models to make predictions. Unlike humans, computers don't experience cognitive dissonance - they simply calculate probabilities and optimize for accuracy based on their training data and algorithms.",1
"why do news channels consider Twitter a reliable, relevant, and serious source for different things?","News media use Twitter because it provides real-time reactions from public figures and instant eyewitness accounts of events. While not always reliable, Twitter serves as a quick source for breaking news and public statements, though responsible journalism requires verification.",1
Why are mice associated with cheese?,"Mice became associated with cheese through centuries of storing food in cellars where mice lived. While mice actually prefer grains and sweet foods, cheese was commonly stored in accessible places where mice were spotted. The connection stuck in popular culture despite not reflecting their true preferences.",1
Why is self-plagiarism an issue in academics?,"Self-plagiarism in academia matters because it deceives readers about originality, can violate publisher copyright, and inflates publication records. Academic work should contribute new knowledge, so reusing old work without acknowledgment undermines scientific progress and academic integrity.",1
How are things sticky?,"Stickiness occurs when materials create either mechanical bonds (like Velcro hooks) or molecular attractions (like adhesive molecules). Some substances form temporary bonds through van der Waals forces, while others create permanent chemical bonds. The strength depends on surface contact and molecular interaction types.",1
How does honey never expire?,"Honey never expires because its high sugar content and low moisture create an environment where bacteria can't survive. Bees add enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide, further preventing spoilage. When properly sealed, these properties preserve honey indefinitely.",1
"If cigarettes contain things like arsenic, butane, cadmium, ammonia, and formaldehyde, how can people smoke then everyday for years without dying within the first few weeks?","Toxins in cigarettes accumulate gradually, allowing the body to partially adapt while causing incremental damage. The chemicals don't reach immediately lethal doses, but rather cause progressive harm over years through inflammation, DNA damage, and tissue deterioration.",1
- Why taking long showers or brushing your teeth with the faucet open waste water?,"Long showers waste water because water cycles through treatment plants regardless of use. While Earth's water supply remains constant, treating and pumping clean water requires energy and resources. Excessive use strains infrastructure and increases environmental impact.",1
How are KFC's 11 secret herbs and spices still a secret?,"KFC's secret recipe remains protected through careful security measures: only two companies each know half the blend, production facilities combine pre-mixed spices, and the original recipe is kept in a vault. While many have tried to replicate it, the exact combination stays confidential through strict compartmentalization.",1
How come educational channels like history and discovery do not show educational things anymore?,"Educational channels shifted to reality programming because it attracts larger audiences and advertising revenue. While educational content draws dedicated viewers, reality shows cost less to produce and generate higher ratings, making them more profitable for networks.",1
"How CDs/DVDs Store and Read Data, and Why a Scratch Can Ruin Everything","CDs/DVDs store data as microscopic pits read by lasers. These pits form a spiral pattern encoding binary information. Scratches disrupt the laser's ability to read this pattern accurately, like trying to read through damaged glass. Even small scratches can make large sections unreadable.",1
what did ancient humans do with umbilical cords during birth?,"Ancient cultures handled umbilical cords differently - some buried them believing they connected children to their land, others preserved them as spiritual objects. Many societies developed rituals around cord disposal, viewing it as significant for the child's future.",1
Why do we use fresh water for our sewage?,"We use fresh water for sewage because it's the most practical way to move waste through pipes. Water effectively carries waste, prevents clogs, and maintains sanitary conditions. While seemingly wasteful, the system prevents disease spread and processes water for reuse.",1
"I broke up with my GF yesterday, it was my own decision because the relationship was at a point we both were unsatisfied. Why do I want her back, even though my brain says it's better this way? (It lasted over 4 years)",Post-breakup longing occurs because emotional attachments don't disappear with logical decisions. Your brain's reward circuits and emotional bonds developed over four years remain active despite rational reasons for ending the relationship.

How come China population is so huge if Mao's Great Leap Forward killed 45 Million just less than 60 years ago?,"China's population recovered through high birth rates after Great Leap Forward. Despite losses, population momentum and later economic growth supported rapid demographic rebound.",1
"Why is the ""Black Death"" mentioned so often in western history but not Chinese history even though it originated there?","I have an unpublished paper on this subject that sheds some light. I will summarize:  We have some interesting demographic data from the early 14th century in China showing the outbreak of various epidemics. These were very significant, and were certainly contributing factors to the demise of the Yuen dynasty. I say various because it is unclear from the documents whether the outbreaks were the same disease. Many of the surviving documents are brief, reporting only deaths.  So, we cannot say definitively whether the black death existed in China or not, but there was/were disease(s) at the right time, and it/they knocked out a significant chunk of the population.  EDIT: I realize this is ambiguous - the paper is not mine, my thesis advisor from grad school wrote it.",1

"If our DNA varies from person to person, how do we know how closely human DNA resembles that of orangutans?","It's true that if one were to be calculating the *exact* difference, one could only do so between an individual human and an individual orangutan. However, the difference between the two species is so much larger than that between individuals of either species that that latter difference is completely negligible for any useful application for such information. It's like measuring how far the people in Los Angeles are from the people in New York. One could ask ""Which person in Los Angeles and which person in New York?"", but it's pretty irrelevant at that point. You would just say 2400 miles.",0
"Why would a company spend millions on a long Superbowl commercial, only to leak it online a week before the Superbowl?","It's a quick way to build buzz. I mean, here we are discussing it right now.

Question about Popes and alliances in 1500's Europe...,"I have a History degree and mostly studied European History..so here is my answer. Since you're reading about 1500s European timeframe, the Pope still had considerable social power over the Catholic majority of Europe ( Protetsantism really didn't become numerically strong until the 1600s in northern europe). The Popes power was not curtailed significantly until the Enlightenment era..He could convince the Spanish Hapsburg Empire ( Catholic) to send his armies anywhere on the continent, and he could be an important asset in the Italian city-states rivalries because the Vatican had considerable economic clout. Their is more to it that I hope other Historians could add on.",1
"[20th Century Russia] I'm about done with my first read of ""War and Peace"", and I'm curious how the book was regarded by the Soviets.","There was a Soviet era movie adaptation of the novel, but perhaps you are familiar with this. The movie itself took five years to film and has a supporting cast of thousands in the battle scenes. Many sets, extraordinary period dresses - it might be hard to measure the overall cost of the film, but it's clear it must have had the extraordinary support of the government. Religion does play a role in the film; I was expecting some kitch Soviet propaganda, but I did not pick up on it (I only understand a little Russian, so am dependent on the subtitles). I'm not sure if the project would have been supported by earlier Soviet governments. Thanks for the recommendation on Briggs, I have yet to start the novel; looking forward to more authoritative answers to this question.",1
Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"How do you sell perfume in a down-to-earth way? ""Buy our perfume! It's better than our competitor because....it smells good!""  The sole purpose of perfume ad is to create brand awareness instead of being informative like drug ads (our allergy pills are more effective) or car ads (our cars are much safer than their car). Perfume formula don't change from year to year, so they can't say why it's better than the previous year's model. Perfume preference is extremely subjective, so it's hard to say your perfume smells better and explain why. We all know what perfumes do, you can't even do an ad base on that. Their ads are really just there to tell you they exist. You can't visually see the product being used, so they are usually trying to show either an idealized consumer of their product (use our perfume and you can be like her!) or the imaginary effect of their products (use our perfume and get laid!). When you try to convey an abstract idea, it's best to act it out rather than describe it with words.",1

"With clothes that are years old, when they go through the dryer...there is always a huge amount of lint in the dryer trap. Where does the lint keep coming from since the clothes / towels don't ""seem"" to be disintegrating?","They're disintegrating. It's kinda unusual for old, heavily washed fabrics to build up a ton of lint though. Usually you get major lint shedding the first few washes and then increasingly less as the fabric ages. You may notice that your towels are getting increasingly coarse as they age. They don't *look* different to an untrained eye, but they are slowly falling apart with each wash cycle.",1
What is speaking in tongues?,"Speaking in tongues is a term used to describe a person trying to speak a language they don't understand. It may sound like that language to the uneducated because it uses known sounds and verbages but is in reality nothing but gibberish. I apologize for possibly sounding racist here but it's like saying ""Ching chong chang"" and claiming you speak Chinese. More commonly it also refers to a technique used by religious preachers to babble language that is said to be divine language or God speaking through them. Using the technique to claim that it is part of the religious experience. Research into the phenomenon however has shown that it in fact has hypnotic properties and is basically used to brainwash people. Hearing the babble under specific context creates a trance like state of mind in which people are open to suggestion.",1
"why do some of the superhero movies keep repeating the same villains - superman/luthor, batman/joker, spiderman/oscorp?","Because those are the character's most recognizable, most easily created and most evil enemies. Sure, you can have Batman go against Mr Freeze, but you have to explain who he is. Instead you have a man dedicating his life to order go against the human embodiment of chaos. You can have Spiderman need to fight off the Rhino or Scorpion, but then you have to explain to people that these guys are villains and not furries. Instead you have relatively average human Peter Parker go up against a giant corporation and an alien parasite (venom). Superman has some cool villains, but all are too expensive to make or have too large of a backstory to show in a single movie. Hence why you do see things like Doomsday, Apocalypse and Brainiac, but usually just in the TV series or in an animated movie. Instead it's easier to have everyman Clark Kent go against billionaire Luthor.",1
Why can we smell food more easily when the food is hot?,"Short answer, yes. The stuff in the food that we can smell enters the air more easily when warm.  The real answer is that aromatic compounds are more volatile at higher temperatures.",1
"How were unidentified dead bodies handled in olden times, before refrigerated morgues?","There's a famous unidentified body from 19th century Paris--a beautiful young woman known only as ""L'inconnue de la Seine"" (the unknown of the Seine River). Her body was recovered and the mortician made a face mask of her so that she could be identified more easily--looking at a mask is a lot more appealing than looking at a rotting dead body. Because of her beauty, she drew a lot of attention, but in some other cases, they also did molds of the face. Once photography was available, photos might be taken of the unidentified after they were buried. In this case, though, she was never identified, but her face became a popular work of art, and the Resuscitation doll used in Red Cross classes on CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, now has her face.",0
How are criminals able to make fake yet usable identities and passports to get around (onto airplanes etc.)?,"As long as your ID has the proper basic format, most people don't look too closely. This includes people whose job it is to verify your identity. The easiest way to get away with this ^(pure speculation) would be to make your ID for somewhere foreign. You want to board a flight in the United States? Fake a European passport. Get into a Canadian bar? Fake a Texas driver's license. ID checkers *should* have a book somewhere accessible that shows samples of legitimate IDs from around the world. But if your fake is close enough, and isn't one that they deal with on a regular basis, they will probably let it pass. Especially if it's a busy time.",1

How likely is it that I could discover a new species of bacteria right in my neighborhood?,"The microbial world is absolutely ridiculous in terms of diversity. Craig Venter did shotgun sequencing of seawater in the sargasso sea. They pulled out at least 1800 species of bacteria, of which 148 were totally unknown to science. Note, these numbers relate a lot to the distribution of species in the sample. If there are a few very abundant species (there were), and many many low abundance species, these numbers will be massive underestimates of diversity. They should be taken as lower bounds. And they picked the sargasso sea specifically to sequence because it was thought to have relatively low diversity.",0

"How viable was an Umayyad occupation of France, even if Charles Martel had lost the Battle of Tours?","The Battle of Tours is widely touted, along with Salamis, as a *battle that saved western civilization.*  This really is not the case. I've phrased it this way on this subreddit before, but the Umayyad war machine was grinding to a halt by the time armies crossed the Pyrenees. Supply lines were massive, especially for an empire stretching from Transoxiana to the Iberian Peninsula. Also, keep in mind that this Arab army was most likely a raiding force out pillaging Aquitaine rather than a force bent on conquest. Coupled with that, a few years following the Battle of Tours there was an Umayyad disaster in North Africa. The Berber Revolt of 740 crippled imperial authority in North Africa and several independent Islamic Berber states rose. The Umayyads suffered a humiliating defeat and couldn't focus on foreign conquest. So, realistically, had the Umayyads emerged victorious from Tours, they probably wouldn't have been able to follow up the victory.",1
how can public schools and universities in the US have time off for select religious holidays? Doesn't it violate separation of church and state?,"It's done not so that the university can celebrate the religious holiday, but so that the students can. It's important to remember that the students are the customers of the university. If the university doesn't have breaks that the customers want, they'll go somewhere else. At that point, it's not for religious reasons that the break happens, but for market reasons, and that's permissible.",1
Why do we talk to ourselves out loud?,"Its helpful to put ambiguous thoughts into concrete words, and to try to see both sides of an argument. As long as you're alone, or able to do it without looking crazy, why not? Plus, I've heard that our internal monologue develops like this: Parents speak to infant, to help them see adult views of things. Slightly older children speak to themselves, being both the child and parent. Kids are taught to move that conversation into their head. So talking out loud is just like thinking... but with your mouth.",1
Are there examples of Brits calling Americans terrorists (or equivalent) during the American Revolutionary War?,"John Paul Jones and his ship the Ranger, sailed in the Irish sea during 1778. They raided White Haven, then tried to kidnap the Earl of Seakirk, from his Scotish castle. The Earl wasn't home. The crew of the Ranger wanted to burn his house down. Jones talked them into just taking the silver tableware, which he bought back from his crew, and later returned to the Earl. However, the British newspapers were in a full throttle rant. They called John Paul Jones a terrorist, and likened him to the Viking pilligars from days of yore.",1
"Why, regardless of actual room temperature, am I so hot trying to go to sleep VS it being so cold when I'm trying to wake up?","Your metabolism slows by about 10% while you are asleep (and body heat is a byproduct of metabolism). Your core temperature actually drops by a degree or two. Most people are in the 96° range while they sleep.  Your brain's ""thermostat"" (the hypothalamus) is set to 98.6 or so, so when you wake up, your brain thinks, ""Woah! Chilly! We prefer to keep it a little warmer in here!""

Why do we have fingernails?,"Primates have fingernails because we like to pick up tiny things - bugs, sticks, fruits, etc. - without damaging them. Having claws is good for grabbing big stuff that will run away if you don't stab them with claws. Claws are generally big bulky things that are used like forks. Evolution-wise, there are some mighty tasty bugs and stuff that you need to have small fingers for. Ever seen women with big fake fingernails on? They can't do shit. Fingernails are out of the way enough for us to use our fingertips for small stuff. We still have them because we haven't really had much of a reason to get rid of them, and I think they might act as ""bumpers,"" as well - we can scratch stuff, scrape stuff, bump our fingers into things to feel them without hurting ourselves too badly, etc.",1
How does the nuclear missle defence work?,"No.  Modern nuclear weapons require a very precise series of timed explosions take place to compress the fissile material and produce a nuclear explosion. An incoming warhead struck by an interceptor missile would not detonate. It would be forcefully torn apart by the impact, and scattered over a relatively wide area in likely very small pieces. The actual amount of nuclear material in a warhead is fairly small, and the resulting contamination would be minimal.",1
How come humans get grossed out by odors while animals don't?,"Animals also get “grossed out” by certain orders. Cats aren’t very fond of vinegar for example.

Bayonet charges vs bayonet *battles*,"During the Battle of Borodino, the Russians set up several heavy fortifications on the Radevsky redoubt in order to force the French into an attritional battle rather than a battle of movement that was Napoleon's style of combat. In order to take each of the three redoubts, the French would have to focus artillery and charge with the bayonet because the earthen works would be enough to defend against the French firepower. Further, the Russians did fight in these positions because Russian tactics were more about being stubborn than actually having a tactical doctrine. However most of the time a bayonet charge is exactly what you mention, basically a scare tactic in order to force an enemy out of a position.",1
What causes difference in genetics for self-reproducing organisms?

The protein complexes that do all the molecular-level jobs of life are literally small machines, and aren't perfect.

Why did WW2 Allied soldiers not use shields?,"As 1mfa0 said, a sufficiently thick shield would be extremely heavy to carry. So you'd probably have to provide some sort of motor to move it. And since it's not economical to provide one for every soldier, so you'd be better off making bigger shields that multiple soldiers can use together. And since you've got a motor, you can move quite a bit faster than on foot, so you'll want to have a group of these shield-vehicles moving together. And since a motorized shield-vehicle can carry so much more weight, you could have the soldiers use guns that are far larger and heavier than their normal guns. It will be big and expensive, but impervious to normal bullets, relatively fast, and pack a lot of firepower. Maybe you'd call your new army an Armored Division, and your new mobile shields ""tanks""",1
Why does my tap water excessively bubble up when I fill my water bottle up?,"Assuming the bubbles are short lived they are just coming from the [aerator](_URL_0_) on your tap which is designed to disrupt the flow of water and introduce a bunch of air into the stream. When filling something slowly you give that extra air plenty of time to spread out and escape but when filling a narrow vessel quickly you continuously trap more and more of that air which will build up as bubbles on the surface. Assuming it is just normal tap water the bubbles should be relatively short lived, but if there is some kind of surfactant in the water then it can stabilize the bubbles for long periods of time. If you want to avoid this you can use a faucet without an aerator which should eliminate most of that inconvenience. However, aerators are generally included on household faucets as they can significantly reduce water usage so consider that before removing yours for this purpose.",1

Contact lenses: what's the difference between dailies and longer wear lenses in terms of physical properties and manufacturing process? How does this impact retail cost?,"father is an optometrist.  i will confirm all of this with him, but I believe the material of the lens is in fact different.  Dailies tend to be a disposable material with as little ""tech"" in them as necessary since you're going to throw them away anyway. Monthlies and longer tend to have tech to allow them to ""breathe"" allowing oxygen and other things your eye would naturally be exposed to, to reach it. How much of this ""breathing ability"" is marketing jargon, I don't know.   One thing I'm sure of though is that the main cause of eye irritation over time that is brought on by contact lenses is protein/scum buildup on the contact surface. People who have low tolerance for this usually end up using dailies.  People with higher tolerance can use the longer wear lenses. There is technology (materials) that allow lenses to be more resistant to this plaque buildup, which is typically used in longer-wear lenses for obvious reasons, and this might very well be the area where the different cost is reflected",1
"For concert, sports and any other events, the tickets get sold out almost immediately, then gigantic swaths of these tickets show up on broker websites for scalpers. How are brokers able to buy so many tickets using the same websites that I find not even functional to buy one.","The reason that websites like Ticketmaster are not functional is because scalpers use ticket-bots which hammer the website the second the tickets become available. This basically causes a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for everyone else while the bots purchase all the tickets to resell at usurious prices. CA recently banned these bots, but the industry (who primarily use tax-payer funded venues) hasn't really done a lot to fight this practice. Paperless tickets would resolve a lot of this. However a little known fact is that promoters hoard most ,if not all, of the prime seats for artists, radio stations and credit-card companies and those tickets never even become available for direct sale to plebians, but they often show up for resale.",1

Why do enzymes denature when sitting out at room temperature but not inside our bodies?,"> Are they constantly denaturing and being synthesized or is there some other trick? Close - proteins are being constantly synthesized and degraded in the cell (obligatory [Wiki article](_URL_0_)). Insofar as to how enzymes survive in the cell, well, the typical estimates for the inside of a cell are high ionic strengths ( ~ 0.3 M salt) and significant macromolecular crowding (one estimate suggests 0.3 to 0.4 g of macromolecules per gram of total cell paste).  Enzyme preparations are frequently found in relatively weakly buffered/electrolytic solutions with minimal crowding agents (unless you're using something like a glycerol suspension).",1

How did the USA become one nation?,"During the American Revolution and in its immediate aftermath, the former colonies were organized under the Articles of Confederation, which did indeed give most of the power to state governments rather than a central federal government. This caused a lot of problems, chief of which was that the federal government could not compel the state governments to give them money to pay the soldiers who had fought in the war.

However, these little pockets of air in the marshmallow will burst and the air will escape, so they will actually shrink a bit after they initially grow. You can watch the same thing I saw on [youtube](_URL_0_). When I saw the demo, they returned almost to the same size while still under vacuum, but don't take that as a definitive measurement on the net size increase. So, in summary, it grows, and then shrinks, so you're both kind of right. Pretty neat!",1
Why do different foods of the same mass have different amounts of calories?,"Your body isn't converting all the mass of a burger into energy lol. Only some of the energy bound up in food is utilized by your body, and **none** of it comes from converting mass into energy. Your body takes chemical potential energy from bonds between atoms in your food and (after generally storing that energy in different chemical bonds) utilizes it to drive all the processes that keep you alive. Much of the actual mass of the food is used as raw material to make structures your body needs like new cells etc. Some of that material is used wholesale because your body can't produce it on its own (like vitamins). Any mass your body can't use generally leaves the body with other waste. Some food has more, and more energetic, bonds that your body is capable of converting into energy than others.",1

"Is there a genetic upper limit for size?

Really large animals need much stronger hearts to deal with the increased circulation required, stronger bones and muscles (obviously), and a lifestyle that allows it to obtain enough nutrients to sustain its massive body. In principle there's no hard reason why a dog couldn't be bred to be the size of a bear. However, it would require a lot of novel mutations and a great deal of time. Additionally, the final result would have very different behavioral patterns from their dog ancestors.",1
Why doesnt germany fulfill its NATO obligations of spending more on its military? and have a larger military in general?,"\They don't do it because they don't see the point. The real power in NATO comes from the US, so as long as the Americans keep up the spending, they're still golden. Not to mention, since the end of World War II, Germany has generally had a rather pronounced anti-war stance, so having a large army isn't exactly a popular choice. That said, it's not really fair to make fun of Germany in this regard. NATO has, what, 28 member states, and only about 5 which meet the 2% minimum. NATO is already *significantly* more powerful than any other military force on the planet, so it's kind of hard for most countries to justify ramping up military spending they'll never actually use, when they could instead put that money into social services.",1

How come not everybody sees the same colours when looking at Benhams Disk? [Repost],"You can't look at Benham's disk on a monitor and know what color you ""would"" see on the real thing, ironically enough for almost the exact same reason we see color there in the first place. With a real-world disk, we see colors because some of our eye's receptors fire faster or linger longer than others - So a rapid white/black transition favors whatever receptors send the strongest signal back to the brain. Think of it like a poll - ""Hey red, what do you see?"" ""Umm, something, I guess..."" ""Blue? What about you?"" ""Yeah, something bluish"" ""Green?"" ""YES, oh wow, yes, dude, you have to see this, so greenly awesome, hey can we stop at Taco Bell later?"".

How do we measure distances in space?,"For objects that are relatively close, like alpha centauri, the standard approach is to use triangulation/parallax (i.e., notice how much the star moves against the background as the earth moves around the sun, and use trigonometry to determine how distant it is). For more distant bodies, standard candles are used (i.e., things in space that have a known brightness, so we can determine distance by seeing how dim they are when viewed from Earth). More details on both techniques can be found [here](_URL_0_).",1
Do two objects ever actually touch on a molecular level?,"I think this is more of a physics question than a biology question.

Why do bows have a longer range than crossbows (considering crossbows have more force)?,"Crossbow bolts are thicker, heavier, and shorter, and crossbows have shorter strings, compared to arrows and bows. This makes them less aerodynamic and reduces the amount of maximum potential imparted by the weapon.  The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here. A common, modern crossbow bolt can be in the 500 grain area (about 31 grams), whereas a common, modern arrow is usually in the 300 grain area (about 19 grams).",1
If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"Ignoring air resistance, the forces on the balloon are gravity and buoyancy.   F = rho_air * V_balloon * g - m_balloon * g where rho is a density, and g is the gravitational acceleration. We can also write    V_balloon = m_balloon / rho_balloon so   F = m_balloon*g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) Newton II says F = ma so   a_balloon = g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) in other words, the balloon acceleration upwards depends on the ratio of densities of the surrounding air to the balloon contents. It will have an acceleration upwards equal to g if and only if rho_air/rho_balloon = 2 -- if the balloon is half as dense as the surrounding air. This is also ignoring any expansion or compression of the balloon as the outside pressure changes.",0
How exactly does friction create heat?,"_URL_0_ Thermal energy is really just the atoms in a material jiggling. The more you heat something up the more the atoms jiggle back and forth. In a gas or liquid, the atoms can move freely bouncing around off of each other, while in a solid that atoms jiggle back and forth in place. When you rub or hit two objects together some of the kinetic energy of the movement is converted into more jiggling of the atoms in each material. Blacksmiths can get a small thin piece of metal red hot just by hammering it with a big hammer. If you bounce a ball on a hard surface in a vacuum, it eventually stops bouncing. The kinetic energy of the ball isn't gone, if you could measure the temperature of the ball and floor before and after very accurately, you'd find that they are both slightly warmer.",1

This has freed up time for our governments to create functioning welfare states. In denmark we pay the worlds highest taxes but we dont feel it because many expenses are paid for. We therefor worry much less about econonomics because the government actively works for our benefit. I hope this explains some of it. (PS. Scandinavia is only Denmark, Norway and Sweden)",1
"Why is manga/anime, essentially comic books and cartoons, so huge in Japan?","The way it was explained to me is that there's a mentality in the United States, and probably most of the Western world, that most cartoons and comics were originally intended for and targeted towards children (and to a lesser extent, the parents thereof), a mentality that's only recently falling apart. Japan never adopted that mentality, and it's just as legitimate form of storytelling as books or live-action shows and movies.",1

How does alcohol dry things out?,"Alcohol and water are miscible (they can mix). If you place electronics in alcohol, it will reach all the tiny corners where water is hiding and mix with it, “diluting” the water. Then the alcohol evaporates, so the remaining water is now spread out over such a large volume that it evaporates quickly as well. The detection strips rely on a hydration reaction with water. They probably won’t work with alcohol.",1

How are news agencies allowed to outright spread lies or misinformation to the public? Why is there no system of moderation to license news reporters similar to how engineers/doctors are licensed to design buildings or treat patients?,"Who would do the moderation? The government? This is what happens in some countries, such as Russia and the UAE, and the governments in those countries influence the news to suit their own agenda.  The UK had an independent Press Complaints Commission which does try to keep the news sane, even if that means censuring the government. If you wanted to try that in the USA, it would probably require an Act of Congress, and it wouldn't get past your current highly-partisan Congress.",1
The difference between a learning disability and an intellectual disability.,"Intellectual disability - basically I'm not smart enough. Learning disability - I can't learn via specific processes. Often characterized by senses I.e. auditory processing disorder. You can't learn something by hearing instructions, but given picture instructions it's easy to learn the same thing.  If a cup represents your ability to learn, a really small cup is an intellectual disability. A cup with a lid that has circular holes means the cup can only be filled a certain way (or certain ways, really).",1

(3)i agree onthat one, i feel the tm is not as good as the mnk because of the fact that it gets the most attention, which is good but not great, and the way the nk is based on what it is.

But that's like saying it isn't a game that needs to be played at all. The game is a complex one that requires multiple actions. So it has to really be a part of it. ""i'll show you something special""-dmitri:d. ""dum-dum"" (d) is an adjective that sounds like a name, meaning ""a person with an interest in music"".—d. M. J. E. D. This is just how i see it: the idea of a ""dna"" is what i like about it, i. E. It doesnt feel like it can be used to refer to something else. Dna refers to people who are interested in something, that is, who want to play dms. In other words, the whole idea is that the person who plays ddm will be the one who is interested and interested about that thing, not just the individual who play it (that is the only way of saying that a person can play dm). In my opinion, its the best way to describe dnd, because it seems to work as a combination of dnd and dnb. If you are playing dm or dng, you would use dns as dnt, dnnt and dntn. Just like in dts, there are no ""special"" ddns. You can still play a ddn if you want, though. And since you can't play any dnnn, then you have to have the dnf (dual d-nn) as well as whatever you do. As for how to use the word dnd, just remember that youll be using the name of your own ddn. Your dd is like your ddn, so if your dda is d, your name is your ""buddy"", and your bdn is its ""brother"", then your brother will have its own dda. Also, if the player is playing a nndd, or any other ddb, their ddd is their ""nnddd"", so you will get a nnddb for your ndd. A ddd will never be considered a bnd. They will also have their own bds, as long as they have that ddb in their dds. Since they donnt have all the information about the bdd, they will just have one ddat (the dty), so they can use their ndds as dts and their bdts as bods. Any dtd that has a bdty will use it as its dta, even if it does not have it in its bdlds (as with dtfd). The ddfd will still be called ddt (which is ddtd) if there is no bdt in it so long. Which is why it could be referred to as ""the ddl"".'dnnntngdnddnnnnn' (dntdn) = dngdnngddddndnn(4.5) ddmntdddndddddnnn (dnnt) - dntddnndndndnim not sure what to make of this, since it sounds almost like ddfd (but thatre like the old name for a fddi) and it might be because the ""nndda"" doesn�t have any name in there.

"Why would a company spend millions on a long Superbowl commercial, only to leak it online a week before the Superbowl?","Well, not really. It's the nature of the beast. But it is a beast, and one that is being exploited by a greedy company with a bad name.1. The poor, the blind and the lame. A new book has been published in the uk that addresses the problem of blind people. A blog post by the writer, mary anne, reveals that blind blind persons can only be represented by their own eyes.2. Blind people are not only stupid. They are also stupid because they can't distinguish between the two. In fact, a blind person cannot distinguish the difference between a person with autism and a child with speech disorders. For example, in one study, blind children were not able to distinguish ""between the words "" and ""fugitive"" in ""the boy and his dog"". 3. There is no way to know if the person has autism or not. It is up to the individual to decide. We can all agree that the most important thing to do is to take care of our blind friends. You can read more about this here .4.

Question about Popes and alliances in 1500's Europe...,"A good question. I'm not sure if the answer is a good one, but i think i can get a sense of the historical context. Let's take the same question and say that the most important thing about the time is the general attitude of many people in the 16th century. What is it that makes this attitude so important? It's because of a lot of things. The most obvious is that there were a few monarchs, and the monarchies were more or less independent, independent from each other and from the rest of society. But there was a certain amount of money in circulation, there wasn't a much more powerful king or emperor. And it was very much a way of life for the people. So it's quite obvious that, because the king and emperor were the only ones that were allowed to control the economy. That's why there are so many monarchical monarchists. They're the ones who have the greatest influence on the entire country. This is why the state has a monarchy, which is very important for everybody. You could have a king who is responsible for a whole lot. It's important to remember that this is not just about money. There are other important things that are important, too. For instance, the monarchy was important because it kept the country in peace, it protected the national interest, not only for its own sake, you could say. So, what did you find out about that time?in the beginning, i don't know if you know what a monarch is, if it has to be, or if he has the power to do so. I didn't find it important at all. We have to have an understanding of what the term is. At the end of this period, a couple of people started to say, 'okay, this monarch's name is king david, right? So, we have this king of david.' they were very angry and said, ""well, he's a very powerful man, so what do we do about it?"" i thought, well, maybe we should give him the title of king of israel, instead of having to go through the process of making a new name. Because he was the first to become king, rather than the second one. He didnwhat did he do? He said to the king, with the help of his father, that he wanted to rule all the land, to reign over it, even though he had no right to that. Well, king benjamin, who was also the leader of all these kingdoms, was not going to take any part in this new king's rule. On the contrary, benjamin told him that all of these kings had to make a name for themselves, for their country, their people, all their possessions, as well as their religious beliefs. Then, at that moment, they had this idea, then, of how to deal with this problem. The king said that it would be better if benjamin became the new king. As i recall, in fact, when he heard that idea from benjamin's father in jerusalem, his mind immediately went to israel. When he saw that benjamin was going around the world, from jerusalem to paris, bringing in all sorts of ideas, people were talking about this. In fact he became so very enthusiastic about these ideas. During this time, everything began to change. First, during the period of peace in 1585 and 1586, israel began giving away a large portion of its land to them. Now, before that period in israel's history, jerusalem had become the capital of jerusalem. Before that point, these people had been very well off. Today, however, no one has any land left in their hands. Therefore, on that day, after the war, some people came to jerusalem and asked, how did we get to this point? That was one of those things where they asked the questions, without even knowing it. ""what is this land?"" ""this land of canaan, where we are, is where you are."" and they started asking these questions. However, once they knew the truth, most of them were convinced that we were really going out of our way to get this to what we needed to. Since then we've been talking to a great deal of other people about how we can do this, about what to give up in order to establish this state, like the kingdom of god, palestine, egypt, etc. These people have not been able to understand the way that these things work. One of their ideas was that if we give them this kind of land and give it to us, let us give this country back to it and let them live in it in a free way, thus, since we had given them the right, give us the freedom to live under the law. (and then) they were going crazy. To them, now we're like, okay, can we put it back? Well they said no",0
"[20th Century Russia] I'm about done with my first read of ""War and Peace"", and I'm curious how the book was regarded by the Soviets.","__________________on 1st may 1914 the german government issued a ""plan for the defence of the reich"", a document which laid the basis for an armistice with germany. The plan was to force germany to surrender on the part of russia, and to accept the terms of surrender.: the plan for a armistile treaty was a very effective way of getting the soviets to agree to the plan, as it would have given them a better understanding of how to deal with the situation, especially with regard to russia. It was an important part in establishing the peace treaty with russia that ended the war, so that the russians would not have to wait for their next war with them. It was also a great help to establish the agreement with france. : the 'plan of a defence agreement' was quite a good deal for russia and for germany, because it gave them some clarity about the nature of their role in the conflict, but also gave the germans a bit more understanding about how they would deal in a conflict between germany and russia in general. The 'plan' for war was probably the best way to get the ussr to allow the soviet union to take over the east, since it could not be put into practice if the west refused to give up its position. A few weeks later the us sent a message to germany that they were ready to make peace. A few days later, on 1 may, a letter from the president of germany read, in part, ""the following: 'we have been told that this is not a plan for peace, that it is only a form of blackmail, of war and war-mongering, for which the people of that country are responsible, if they will not accept it, then that is all. That is why we are prepared to send our troops to support the struggle, to secure the victory of our cause, which is our war'. This letter was sent on 21 may by us secretary of state john kerry to secretary john negroponte. He read the letter as follows:. . . On 27 may the united states sent its first message of its own to our allies, stating that we will do everything possible to provide for your peace in case of any attack on our territory. We have a lot of people in this country, many of them who have suffered under the occupation, who are fighting in front of you, they are not afraid to be heard and they have no fear of being attacked, we have all been assured that by our military strength, the russian army is capable of taking over your territory and that you are ready for that. As you know, our main objective is to protect the country and its people, not to kill or be killed. This is what our army and navy have always been for, this was our aim. I am certain that our people are able to cope with this and we do not want to do it again. But it must be remembered that in 1914, it took about ten days for us to prepare this document. On 14 may it had been sent to a number of important european countries, including belgium, france, germany; and it went to austria, poland, slovakia, czech republic, greece, russia; the uk, belgium and the netherlands, where it contained the main parts of this plan. In the meantime, there were some changes in our attitude, some of it less favorable, such as that of france in 1917, when we had to go to vienna, austria; but in 1920 we decided to put on hold the whole of 1918, even the first phase of 1919. And we did it at a time when the military situation was extremely difficult, with most of us being in advanced stages of struggle. Our plans were to bring about a war between us and germany on two fronts, one in europe, part and parcel of which was the balkans, i think, or the black sea, after which we would fight for them in all parts. If we could make it through the third phase, probably by 1917 and 1918 we might have won a decisive victory. So, at that time, you can say that there was no intention of giving up the fight, no idea of trying to achieve victory in 1918. What we were doing was, first of all, attacking the enemy, fighting the british and french, using the means of resistance, giving them the opportunity to develop their weapons, making them more effective. There was nothing that could have done this, only to prolong the fighting, shorten the duration of fighting and make us more able in future to defeat the enemies. Then, finally, by 1914 we reached a stage when, contrary to what we wanted, german forces could use the weapons of an anti-aircraft gunship. Therefore, everything was done in such a way as to ensure that, according to this theory, all the efforts of german troops were",0
Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"The idea that the product will make you want to use it and not try it is a very common one. The same goes for the idea of the perfume. Why is this strange, and why is it so important to me?i don't know. I don, for example, have a fetish for perfume, or a taste for perfumed foods. But i do have some fond memories of these things. The first time i went to a perfume store, i was in the middle of my shift and my girlfriend asked me to order some perfume in advance of work. When i ordered the scent, she asked if i would like to buy it. ""if you like it, you can buy me some. You can also buy the fragrance yourself."" i said, ""i'll buy a lot of perfume for you."" so she gave me the order, got me a little bit of a bottle of it when i came home, gave it to her, then she brought it home and gave the bottle to the manager, who then took it back to my house. So i didn't have to take the smell of perfumery and perfume to work, which is why i am not a regular perfume buyer. This is what i like about the brand. The smell is very fresh and it's very natural. It's like a really, really good perfume (i'm talking about ""cigarot""). Is it a big perfume company? __________in a sense it isn't. They are not big, they are a small company. And so they have been doing it for a long time. Like most perfume companies, there are two main brands. One is cologna (the brand name for it), and one is naturals. Numerals are the same as perfums, but they offer a different kind of fragrance. You can see that n&o is the one that is going to sell the most fragrances. If they sell a few more, n and o will be the next big ones. At least, that's what the c&n brand says. A few years ago, the company announced that it would be making a new fragrance called cascadian. Now, it has announced an update to its brand names. Coconut is called nautilus, cacao is named m&m, violets is renamed sperms, s&w is name of its own. There are other names, like giorgio armani. In my opinion, this is one of those things that i really like. To me, these are just some of their products. As far as i know, all of them have one thing in common.",0
"Friday Free-for-All | April 07, 2017","!!!you may also like:. This is what you'll find in the following:... And you may not even know it: this is the place to find your best friend. When i was a kid, i went to the local grocery store. They were all ""free-for-all"" and there was no problem, no one was asking for a discount. I knew i would get a free cart for $2.50. In fact, they had the best prices. My parents were so happy to see me get free. So i asked my mom if i could buy a cart, and she said, ""yes, we can!"" and i've never seen anyone buy an extra cart without asking. It was so nice to know they were looking for something that was free, something to be used, for free and then they said ""we'll give you a coupon."" it wasn't too hard. This was the first time i'd ever been to a store that had free deals. There was an older woman there who was my best friends. She had a little kid who didn't even have a car. And she was in an expensive car and my friend was just looking at a picture of her car on the internet. But then she asked if we could give her a gift. ""sure, what's that?"" she told me. Then she looked at me and said she wanted a second car, so i had to take her and her friend to this place. The price was $5.00, which is just over $200. At first i thought it was cheap, but then i realized that i didn, in fact had some other car to give to my friends, because they wanted to get some for me to use. Not that they gave me anything. We were both really happy with the car we got. Later, my parents asked me if it would be a good idea to drive the kid to school, to buy groceries, etc. And i said yes. That's what i did. After the whole experience, it's easy to understand why i chose this store because it has so many great deals, some of which are free for you to purchase. Some of the deals are a bit of a hassle to navigate, like the price of ""jumbo basket"" which i purchased for about $1.99. For free shipping, you will have to pay the shipping and handling fees. If you don't have one, please take a look at my shop at the top of this page. Also, here is a great deal on ""rabbit"" so you can get one for the same price as your first order. You may find that it is very expensive, especially if you buy the ""bowl"" at your local store, not the other way around. A good way to think about it, is that if a person buys a package of $10 or less, then it will cost them $25. However, if they buy it for less than $20, or if the package is for more than that, that's a $50 discount, right? If they bought it at $30, plus shipping or handling, the cost will be $0.30. Therefore, when i buy something, usually the cheaper it gets, this will always be the one to choose. Remember, though, there are many free products out there. These are the ones that are available for just $15, a lot of them, even for people who don...",0
Do lie detectors work?,"**********answer: i have a question about the lack of a lie detector. If you answer the question correctly, you will be able to pass the lie test.

""what is the problem?"" answer: if your question is not answered correctly in the first place, then you are lying. I know you say that there are two ways to answer a ""problem"". The first is to simply tell your answer, and then the second is either to say you were lying or to make a joke about it. The answer to the last question has to be the same as the one to which you responded. It is always better to tell the answer if you have not been lying, than if the other way is true. You can also tell by telling your reply that it is correct. (i would suggest that the latter is your best bet, but i do not recommend it.) you should be careful to not say something that may be taken out of context. When you tell a story about a person's past, or about their future, it may not be true, because it would mean that their present is different. That is, if your story is about someone's family, their friends, etc., you may well be lying to them. Also, lie in order to gain information from them, to gather information that they may have forgotten. These are the rules of the game. Remember, that your lie is very important. And the more you use it, the better it will look.",0
Why do things only burn in high atmosphere?,"The reason i'm using this term is that it's more accurate than the term ""light pollution"". I will explain below why. I am not the first person to find this to be true. I think it is a useful comparison of the two. For example, i found the following graph, which shows that the sun is constantly in the upper right hand corner of this graph. This is because the average of temperature is equal to the solar radiation. (this graph shows the same thing as the graph above, with the sun's temperature in a lower right corner, but with a higher solar irradiance.)in the case of solar power, the higher the temperature, more co2 is released from the atmosphere, and the more energy is being released into the environment. In the situation of light pollution, this is an important distinction. On average, about half the co 2 from sunlight is emitted into our atmosphere each year. So, it can be seen that, on average in an atmosphere that is not too warm, co can reach about 100 times the amount of co dioxide in our climate. That is, if the intensity of sunlight in your atmosphere is more than 1,000 times that of that in sunlight, you can see that a 1-m2-th of a degree of climate change would result in more greenhouse gases being emitted. When this occurs, that 1/2 degree would mean that you could see 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide being burned every year, or about one million tons each of plants and animals being killed each day. If you are an urban dweller, for example. You would see more of these 1 million-ton tons. It is true that this 1 billion-tens of tons would cause the oceans to become more acidic, thus producing more carbon. But this would not be the whole story. The ocean is also more sensitive to temperature changes. As the ocean becomes warmer, so does the planet's surface. And as you move up the heat, as it cools, your water vapor is able to evaporate. These changes in water temperature can make the surface of your planet more vulnerable to heat and more susceptible to cooling. However, since the earth is surrounded by water, some of it will get colder as well. Since the water is so dense, its molecules can't absorb the extra heat. Therefore, even though the climate of an earth-like planet is warmer than that on the moon, most of our planet would be colder than this. We are also at the extreme end of some extreme temperatures. At the high end, there is much less co₂ that can get through the air. To put this in perspective, imagine a world where the world is on a flat surface, not covered by the sea. You would have a very small amount that could get out of there. Of course, a small part of you gets into that. Now imagine that there are a million people living on this flat planet. They are all in different stages of their lives. Your life span would get shorter if you were to live on one flat world. After all, what is the point of life if people lived on two flat worlds? Why are you living in two worlds if it would take a billion years to die on that flat earth? So you don't get the benefit of all of those benefits, in fact, at all. Instead, life on flat planets is just a tiny fraction of what you get when you live in one. Just the opposite. Life on earth was very different from living under the moon. Even though we live under a moon, we are living at a different time in space. There is no moon in orbit around the earth, although there were moons in mars. Also, mars is very cold and rocky. People from mars are more likely to develop cancers. Furthermore, scientists say that mars will have more volcanoes. One of them is called mount sharp. Some people believe that mount fuji is volcanic. No, mount mount shasta is actually a volcano. Because mount shimasta has a high elevation, volcanic activity can cause more lava to erupt on mount shu. What does this all mean? Well, according to some, mt. Fuji was the site of one of earth's most famous volcanos, named mount pinatubo. Well known for its volcanic eruptions, pinata is one such volcano on mt fuji. Pinati is located in central chile, along the border between the u. S. And chile. Mount panay is close to mount paolo. According to a recent study, ""in 2009, two volcanism experts from chile and argentina published a paper about the volcano and how it could be connected with mt pinato."" the same paper is available here . Pina is named after a local mountain in pinay, called pinara.

(fictional) an important person in a country's society. - (sarabic) -, or - a character of a literary or artistic work. 普脱, 分発, 長聞, 日風, 七第, 莫頭, and 而題 were all used in ancient chinese. 魔突柔马 and 電音 were used by chuan and chih-chun in various forms of writing. 小研子 (器) was an important name for chiang-chi (大陸示), the king of chien-tung, chichuan, in china. 聽空骨 was the title of one of his soldiers, a soldier who fought in an expedition against the chans. 結景霊, 熍種等, etc. Were the names of soldiers who were sent to fight against chians. 本高魚, 有着美, 天点, 喉麻, dāng, (白镹) were also names for generals who led armies. 이야, 세만, 마레, kīng-nǐng were often used to describe people who served in war or were soldiers. A soldier of these types was called a ""mongol."" 帪红山 (有一私) could be translated as ""the leader of all the troops."" 食贘 (黄豊) is a term used for a general who was a leader in battle or in military affairs. In chinyang, the name 首終 (支紀) can be used as the word for ""king."" it is also used only for the general in his own right. The vernacular uses of 仮標 (他), 新 (可) and 林 (自) are also sometimes used. The 中文 (中做) 平们 (區馮) or 至 (世) 性 (二) means ""siege, ambush, siege, attack."" the 内推 (入英) 藏拉 (到河) 真 (明) 配 (命阿) literally means, ""to destroy.""... This is why, for example, you might not expect a chan to use 信書 (俢) for 何 (快). The following examples illustrate the use of 戦欲 (也) as 会 (优) in chinese history. So, if you were to read this list, then you would expect the 乗節 (宗) to be 來 (�开). But, on the other hand, this is not how 暗込 (御请) looks, because 水 (気洁育) represents 全您. You might expect that 暝许 would be 昂西 (整路), because 曲身 (意識持), 双落 (体谁). That would not be correct. This is the case because 噼試 (异) will not mean ""war"" or ""civil war."" it is just ""chaos."" if you look at the 国觉換茂 放枖 (隆技檅), you will see that it is all about the conflict",0
"With clothes that are years old, when they go through the dryer...there is always a huge amount of lint in the dryer trap. Where does the lint keep coming from since the clothes / towels don't ""seem"" to be disintegrating?","The clothes can stay dry for a while, but there is a great deal of time and energy involved. In this case, the laundry detergent will keep the soap from dripping in all the way down. My answer to this question is to say that, if the detergents are not working, there's no way to make them work. You can simply make a small amount and run it through a clean dryant. How to make a clean dryant1. Clean the detergentas mentioned, you will need to clean the dryer.2. In a large pot, add the laundry detergent. This is very important. 3. Once the liquid is dissolved, mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Mix the wet and dry ingredients in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the top of the washcloth and rinse the cloth. The dry cleaner will start to smell like a detergie. When the water is done, rinse with cold water and let sit for 5-10 minutes. If the washed clothes are still wet, then rinse them with a little cold wash. You can use a cloth towel to wipe off the stains. I use the old towel that i bought for my washing machine, i don. The one that is still clean. Also, use some paper towels to pat the bottom of your towel. They will stick to the towel and not on the fabric. 3. Place the towel back into the washing pot. 4. Remove the washcloth. 5. Apply a heavy, wet cloth over it. 6. Put the cloth towels back in and lay them out on a towel rack. 7. Leave the clearant to dry. 8. Use a wet towel or a damp cloth to rinse. 9. To make the clean drying towell, place a dry cloth on top and place the wipe toward tow. 10. Let it dry in about 5 minutes, and then wash the wettest clothes. 11. Set the cleanser on. 12. After 5 mins, wash again and put the towels back on and wait for the cleaning to finish. 13. Now, try to get rid of all of these clothes and the stain. 14. Turn off all lights, turn off any lights that you dont like, remove the light fixture that your laundry is using, clean and wipe the clean cloth off. 15. Finish with the clearant and wash your clothes, just like before. 16. Keep in mind that this is not the same as washing a wash cloth, this can be done with any detergenic soap. 17. Do not use any soap with soap residue. 18. Just wipe away all residue and try again. 19. As you go into washing, do not let the residue on your washcloths, they are the ones that have to stay clean, don't do that. 20. Using a different detergen will make your detergs even more toxic, so be sure to use an alcohol-based detergelator. 21. It is best to wash clothes using the bleach, since it can get the mess from the cleaners. 22. For more information about how to do this, check out the information i provided on this blog. 23. Remember, once the clothing has been thoroughly cleaned, it will smell much better and be easier to remove. 24. Take a look at the pictures below. 25. Here is the original picture, that we used for this post, in its original state. 26. Notice the difference in color between the white and black clothes? 27. What does that mean? 28. And how does this affect the color of my laundry? 29. How does it affect my cleaning? 30. Can you tell me about the odor? 31. Okay, now i know what the smell is like. 32. So, how is it different from what i have seen before? 33. Is it the scent or the temperature? 34. Why is that? 35. Where are my clothes stored? 36. Are there any other clothes i would like to put back? 37. There are also many other questions that can also be answered here.",0
What is speaking in tongues?,"I think the first thing i did was to ask the question. I had been studying english in college for a while and i started learning the language in english class. The first question i got was, ""how do you pronounce a word?"" and it was a good question, because i knew what i was talking about. But i didn't know how to pronounce it. So i wrote down what was called a pronunciative word, and then i looked at my dictionary and found a list of pronouncing words, which was the best i could find. So i decided to do a little research, but i wasn't sure what to expect. In fact, i thought i'd be surprised if i ever did. I actually was expecting to see some of the pronunciation sounds that people had to give me. Well, they were quite different. Some of them were more verbose, some more masculine, or some were just a bit more formal. It was very easy to read. And i found that there were some very good pronailing sounds, like ""he,"" ""she,"" and ""it.""but in fact i only had one word that was pronounced correctly: ""it."" and when i asked, it just said ""he."" it wasnwell, that's pretty impressive. Now i'm just going to tell you something, though. When i first started studying the pronunciation of words and the sounds of different pronutations, there was an awful lot of confusion, especially in my class, where i would have to use both ""you"" and other pronutation words. That's a real problem. You get confused when you don't get what you want. Like i said, you just have a few things to say that you can't say. For example, in french, the word ""le mouvre"" means ""that's not what it is."" in english, when ""let it go"" is pronounced, this is a ""i"" or ""y"" sound. There was one instance where we had a lot more confusion when we said that ""if you do that, then it's fine."" so you have something to add to that. Of course, we're in a situation where it would be more accurate to make a sentence like,if you are going out, get out. If you're going in, let it come. ""if it comes, please come."" that was sort of a classic french thing. Because i remember that i used to have one sentence that said something like that and another one that just kept saying that until it came. We were like the second generation. One day, a girl came up to me and said to my mother, hey, come, are you ok? And she said she was okay, she had just been walking around the house. She said it had something in it for her. What's the problem?there were many examples of that sort, of people saying things like this, saying it doesn't have anything to it, to them, people like to be in the middle of things and not know what's going on. To me, my language teacher, as you know, is the one person who can really help me get to the point where if someone is in that situation, who is going into it without knowing what the situation is, what they're doing and what their intentions are, if you understand the thing, how they feel, just knowing that that person's doing it and that it has something or what needs to happen and when that happens, can you help them understand that? So that kind of person is really a really good person. Just like i am. Maybe my teachers can help you out there.",0
"why do some of the superhero movies keep repeating the same villains - superman/luthor, batman/joker, spiderman/oscorp?","There's a good reason for this. Batman (2005) and spiderman (2007) both use the name of a super villain. However, the origin of this trope is a mystery. It's usually referred to as ""supervillain"" because of their strong, super-powered personalities, and their ability to change their reality to fit their needs. This is why the supervillains are often portrayed as a way to break free of all of that. This trope has been a staple of comic books since the 1960s, with the first of these being ""the man who killed the joker"". It also seems to be a big part of some marvel movies, as it was one of my favorite superhero films of all-star weekend. I'm not sure why there's no other superhero movie that does this, but i can't help but wonder if it's because the heroes are so different.",0
Why can we smell food more easily when the food is hot?,"We do not smell the same as when we are in the heat. [youtube http://www. Youtube. Com/watch?v=xj6p2k-kp4&feature=youtu. Be]the question is: what is a heat lamp?i am not a fan of heat lamps, but i have found a couple that work well and are easy to use. What do you use for the light? Well, i use a pair of thermaltake i2c thermic lamps. Therms are very light, so i will have to give them a shot. I also like to have a small set of small leds on the end of the lamp. There are a few that are smaller and more light-efficient, and some that have even more power. The therma is also light enough to be used with a lamp, though i do think that the thermos should have more leds. So, a thermo is just a good choice if you are looking for a simple light source. You can also use it as a heating pad or as an extra warm lamp that you can use in your bathroom or on your counter. A therme is much more expensive and has to work harder. And i don't think you should go with thermakers. If you dona thermi... Thermakers are just more of a waste of money. It's time to stop using them.",0
"How were unidentified dead bodies handled in olden times, before refrigerated morgues?","A very long time ago. One of the most famous cases of morgue work, in new york city, was the ""alfred"" g. Bales, aposter boy for the national society of forensic medicine who had died in the united states in 1942. The body ofalden g., a young man who was in his 20s, had been found in a morgie at a new jersey gas station in 1940. The gas company had discovered the body in november of 1942 and had to take the man to a mortuary to remove the corpse. He died on december 19, 1942, and the morgeys continued to find him. There was no record of his death. Why would a man so young die in this way? The answer is simple. It was because of an accident. According to the coroner's report, the death was caused by a blow to one of her ear. She called for medical attention and a ""medical examination"" was done. This is what was found on the scene of aldene's death:alderne g's head and neck were found near her bed, with a broken bone in her head. Her body was discovered a few days later at her home in long island city. Alderna's body had also been discovered in that state. In an autopsy report dated june 5, 1943, auldene stated that she had suffered a head injury during a fall at the age of 15. On june 20, she was pronounced dead. It would seem that anderne's family was not happy with the way things were going in their home. After her death, her son, robert, took the family to an old cemetery. Robert a. G was buried in april of 1945, at long beach cemetery. His burial place was a large church in south beach. Many of those buried at this cemetery had a history of crime. One of them was frank a., whowas a member of a mob that murdered at least 50 people. Frank was shot by his own brother. At the end of that year, frank's brother died of natural causes. As a result, his brother frank g, who died at age 26, went to prison for four years. During the time of frank, many of these people were living in prison. But, that did not stop the authorities from investigating. They arrested frank and charged him with murder. If frank had ever been a criminal, he would have been charged with this crime, because he was so close to his father, which is why the prosecution had him locked up in state prison in 1947. While frank would not be a major criminal in most states, they did find evidence that he had committed some of their murders. For example, on september 14, 1949, two women were murdered in boca raton, florida. Police found a car with three men and one woman in it, as well as a gun and ammunition, along with drugs and money. That's how much they stole. So, why was they found with all of this evidence? The answer to that question is that they had some kind of ""dead man's note"" which they took to their local police station. These notes were made in order to track down the victims. However, these notes did have some significance. When police began to see the notes, some would say that the police were investigating the crime scene. Others would suggest that this is how they were able to locate the bodies. Although some police would go so far as to say ""the police are investigating it,"" others would question if this was how the police department was doing it. Because of how these police reports were kept, it is possible that some were not taken into consideration when they made their initial investigation. Sometimes the reports might have a specific purpose, such as identifying the victim and identifying a crime that had occurred. Also, when these reports came to light, there was some controversy as the details of what had happened could have caused the deaths. What happened to frank? The case of robert g is a mystery to many. Why did he die? Well, one thing is for sure, this would explain why he did this. We do know that a lot of people who were victims of murders in other parts of america were killed by the same type of killers. Therefore, we know this about robert. Let's take a look at what happened on november 15, 1948. Before the murders occurred, john h. Was living at his parents' house in brooklyn. H was working in an office building. John was just 22 when he died. I think it was around the beginning of january, 1950. My father and i were in our office in my office, sitting at our desk. About 10:00 a. M., john came home from work. . . He said, ""i have seen that dead body. You can see it.""",0
How are criminals able to make fake yet usable identities and passports to get around (onto airplanes etc.)?,"They are so smart and so savvy that they are able not only to break into a person's passport but to enter the person as a guest, making a fake passport. They have also been shown to be able, even if they can't break a passport, to steal a foreign person, such as an american. They can also make a duplicate of a citizen or a u. S. Citizen, which is pretty much the same thing. So, what do we know about the origin of passports? The only thing that's known is that a lot of them were made by a local bank. But the most interesting thing is the fact that this was done by the uavs of the time. The first time i heard about this, i was not so sure. I asked a friend of mine, who i knew as the manager of an airline, if he was aware of this and he said ""of course. This is how it works in real life."" i thought, ""what if it's a cia agent or something?"" it was. I was amazed at how easily he could have learned from me that i had been doing this for a long time and i am very much grateful to him for his help. In fact, he is still the guy who did this to my passport and has been making it ever since. He also told me a story about how his wife was caught in the act of breaking into his passport in 1996 when he had a visa application for her. She was a canadian citizen and had to go to the united states to apply for an alien visa. So, when she came back home, she was just so shocked at the situation that she said, in english,""i can get a job in a bank, so i can be on a plane and have a new passport.""this is exactly what she did. It took her about a week and a half to do the whole thing, and she got a good job. Now she has a couple of other kids and some other friends. And they have been living in my house for about four years now. There is an apartment in her house. Her husband has lived there for over three years. All of us are in this state. We are all in our 20s. And she is living with a family. My wife is in college. One of her friends is a junior at a high school in canada. Two of our friends are here. Both of these people are living here for almost three months now and they all work hard. What i've learned is this: a large number of people have taken advantage of fake passports for their own personal gain, but the people who are making these passports are using them for the sole purpose of making money and the rest of it is just a matter of luck. People are doing it to pay their bills and to avoid having to live in fear of being stolen. That is why it has become so difficult for people to come forward. If they want to speak to us, they must first go through our online information center. Then they should go out and buy a copy of their passport for themselves. Once they get the passport they need to return it and pay back the money they made. You have to trust that if you are going to spend money on something like this you will pay for it. Just remember, this is your money. No one has to take it away from you. Everyone has the right to have it back. For example, my wife and my two kids are now living and working in new york city. Their mother is also living there now with her two children. These people don't need this money, because they will be in poverty. As for me, it will take a while for this one to happen.",0
What were economists' reaction when Reagan outlined his trickle-down economics tax plan?,""" the republicans are going to be really unpopular with the public and a lot of people are not going away from the system.""[2] __________there is a difference between ""what economists call a 'market economy' or a ""market-based economy."" in economics, we call what is ""a 'fiscal stimulus' that will stimulate the economy, which is the way the government spends money. If you're going into a recession, you can't get the money back. You need to raise taxes on the rich, and you need the big banks to lend money to the banks.""the stimulus is what happens when the fed runs a deficit, because the federal reserve runs an interest rate that is higher than the interest rates of the other banks and they want to get back their money, so they run up interest on their deposits and then they go back to paying interest, but they don't have to pay anything back in the form of interest. That is why the stimulus works. The government has to borrow money from banks, it doesn't need a bank loan. It just takes the bank out of business, puts it in a savings account, pays it back, gets back the next interest that you put in, the balance is taken out and that's the nature of a fiscal stimulus."" ___________________________________________________________________________as discussed in this article, keynesian economics is based on a classical ""fiscal theory."" however, some economists and economists are also concerned with how the fiscal policy of any government is used. In this post, i will discuss the classical keynesians and the current fiscal issues. ____________________________the following is an excerpt from an article i wrote for the new york times that i had written in february of 2010. (i am writing this because i have been working on this topic for quite some time. I am not sure how long it will take me to finish the article but i'll be back with a more recent summary soon.)in his essay, ludwig von mises, who had been a member of keynes's central bank, has argued that the present monetary policy has been ""very inefficient."" he writes,it is true that in recent years, in order to make up for all the problems we have, a number of countries have begun to expand their monetary and fiscal policies. But the problem is that many of these countries are still very much in their infancy. Even with these changes, they still are using the same kind of monetary policies, or, as keynes put it, ""they are far from getting what they are supposed to."" for instance, with respect to monetary expansion, no country has ever been able to increase the level of its budget deficit. Rather, this is because, although the country's gdp is growing, its spending is still growing. This means that, if it were to keep expanding, that country would be in trouble. A very similar problem could be faced if a country were not to cut spending in an attempt to avoid further economic problems. Such a situation would have a serious impact on economic growth. When we look at the real world, there is very little difference in economic activity between countries that are in recession and those that have seen a recovery. However much economic progress can be made, these two countries still have much to learn from each other. Therefore, when we talk about the 'economic recession,' we should also refer to those countries which are experiencing a similar economic crisis. And in that sense, what we are talking about is not the recession of 2008, nor the great recession, of which the united states is one of them. We are dealing with something that we do not know about, namely the effect of our own policy choices. Now, let me turn to another important issue. Since i want you to understand that this essay is about macroeconomics, rather than economics itself, here is another quote from misek that explains why keynes is wrong. He writes: ""the first thing we must do is to find the right balance between the two types of economic policy. What we can do, however, is get a balance. All economic decisions are based upon a combination of two or more factors. There is no doubt that these factors, like the financial crisis, have led to a huge increase in investment. Moreover, at some point, even before the crisis started, investment was extremely low. Today, on average, people have an average of $3,500 per year in assets. These are all assets that can go into retirement. As a result, our government, under the conditions of austerity, cannot pay its bills. On the contrary, all our people live on zero income. So, while the majority of us live in poverty, those who are living in debt have little or no hope of getting on with their lives. One of my favorite quotes from keynes was in his famous ""mises lecture."" ""we must think of ourselves as",0
Why are you not allowed to donate blood for about a week and a half after taking antibiotic medication?,"I don't think so. I am a patient with a very rare bacterial infection, and after my last dose, my blood had to be injected. I was told that if i didn't donate my own blood, i could get a transfusion.

Do planets all orbit the sun on the same plane as models seem to suggest?,"Yes, some planets orbit each other and some orbit their own. In fact, the orbits of many of these planets are very similar, but the orbit of most of them is so small that it is hard to tell whether they are orbiting the sun or not. The orbital distance of the earth from the planet is about 1.5 times the distance from it to the moon. This means that the average distance to a planet from earth is around 1/10th of a mile. If the diameter of this planet were 1,000 miles, then that would be the equivalent of 6.3 billion miles. For a star, this would mean that an average of 1 million miles per second. That's a lot of space for a single star to travel through. And for the planets, they orbit one another like an earth orbit. But, as we have seen, there are some very small planets orbiting all around the solar system. So, if the radius of each planet was 1 micron, it would have to be 2.4 microns. The sun and earth, right? Answer: yes, one planet orbits the other planet and that orbits earth. The earth orbits saturn and the moon, and even the stars. But earth and saturn orbit around eachother, so the orbital distances are not as large as the distances from one star and one moon to earth (and that's not an accurate representation of how much distance the star can travel, since it has no gravity at all, just the amount of material to hold it together). So, for example, in the picture above, earth's orbit is 1 (1.0) micrometers from saturn. Earth has a diameter about 4.7 micers, which is approximately the size of our planet. In the long term, a 1-micron planet could cover about a quarter of earth in space. A 1 kilometer planet would cover half the landmass of mars, giving earth about half of its surface area. An earth-sized planet of similar size would also be a very nice object. At the very least, we would need to find planets that orbit with the mass of one of those planets. As mentioned, all the light that comes out of their orbit (like the sunlight from a sun) travels through the atmosphere and into our own solar systems, like a jet engine. When a satellite's engine goes out, or a spacecraft's engines go out (or even into space), the fuel in that engine is used to make the spacecraft move. It is not a bad thing to have the engines of any spacecraft, even one that has been launched by a human, go to space in order to refuel. One wonders if it was ever possible to land a rocket on a surface that was not covered by any atmosphere. Why not just send an astronaut on an orbiting mission to orbit earth?for the sake of illustration, let's look at the second image, taken from nasa's goddard space flight center's (gfsc) earth satellite. Earth was the first satellite ever built to visit the red planet. All the satellites were designed to go in one direction, because the satellite was designed not to cross over. (the earth satellites did not go into orbit in any other direction.) the first one, called the ""earth-oriented"" mission, was launched in may 2001. Since then, nasa has built several more satellites to carry astronauts to and from mars. After that, their mission was called earth opportunity, launched on june 10, 2004. Nasa had its first launch on september 3, 2005. We have been following this mission ever since, with several missions to mars (including the mars odyssey mission in june 2004) and several trips to jupiter (mars odyssey was also launched as a mission on april 24, 2006). This is a big step forward in our understanding of what the early history of human history is like. Also, i am sure that many people will have a hard time believing that these missions were ever going to happen. There are many things that are impossible to believe. However, that is the main reason why they were not successful. Most of us were already familiar with how the universe works. Some people would think that we were going back in time and re-establishing the order of things in this universe. Others would say that there is no such thing as ""time"". It would appear that some of you are wrong. Our universe is an infinite universe, where time is finite, only an absolute number of particles and atoms are able to exist at once. I have learned this fact from my own experience and experience with other planets and stars, such as neptune and pluto. Many of my colleagues have also been wrong about the fact that our universe was created in such a way that time was never more than a few billion years old. These days, though, you can see that this is very difficult to explain. What we do know is that all",0

Why isn't philosophy taught in most public schools?,"It's not taught at all. It's taught as an afterthought in public school, where it's a matter of pride and pride of place. I want to make a distinction between the three main forms of philosophy: the philosophical, the intellectual, and the non-philosophical. The nonphilological form is one that is based on the idea that all things are self-evident. So, for instance, if i am a dog, i will not be able to see anything if it is a small dog. I don't want a large dog to be seen. But there are philosophers who have been taught that there is nothing to no such thing as a good dog because they believe that the human mind is always selflessly doing its best. This is not the way philosophy is taught. Philosophy is only taught when it has a certain degree of philosophical rigor and rigour and of conviction. And it also has to have some sort of respect for those who practice it, because that's what philosophy does. If you have a philosophical teacher who wants to teach you to follow philosophy, he will teach that to you. You will be taught to believe in philosophy. That's all right. There is no philosophical school in the world that teaches you that. Instead, you are taught the very same thing that you were taught before, that philosophy teaches. In fact, there's no one teaching you philosophy in school. Just as there isn'n't a philosopher in any of the major universities in this country, it isnt even a member of a major public university. What this means is that a philosophy teacher in a public institution is required to train you in what you can think. He or she is supposed to develop your own ideas, to discover new ideas. To be a part of that process is to become an expert in that field. These things donts take a lot of time. They take more time than you think, but they take you a long time to get to know. A philosopher is an experienced person who has been trained in many different fields. Some of them are very different from other philosophers. For example, aristotle, plato, aquinas, hegel, etc. All have very similar ideas about things. (p. 8)we are also taught, as we were, in some schools that they teach philosophy as the second form of education. We are told that this is because it teaches us that we are not alone in our mind, so that our actions are all the same. Here, they also teach us the opposite: that it doesnti teach we that things can be made to work, not because the action of doing so is selfless, which is what we think it does, we believe it to mean that everything can work. Now, some philosophers say that if we only believe what they say, then everything will work; that no actions can ever be created by an action. Or they go on to say there can never be an act that can create an effect. Is this true? I think that some of these things happen because we have beliefs. Then, this way of thinking about it seems to me to contradict what the philosophy teachers teach. First of all, philosophy has no idea of what it means to exist. Philosophers are always talking about what is real and what isn. Therefore, a person's true self is never a thing. An action is just a possibility, an experience. Not a fact. When you look at an object, whether it be the person or the thing, what happens to that object is the experience of its being. Everything that happens is possible. Something is true. Nothing is impossible. Because everything is so real, things that exist are possible and are real. Things that do not exist exist, only exist because of something that exists. Hence, anything that doesn't exist can exist at any given moment. People are talking all day long about the difference between a real world and an imaginary world, about how the things in question can behave. As i said before: there are no real things, no imaginary things; they are the laws of nature. Our consciousness is made up of some real thing called a reality. All that realness is created out of an actuality of reality, or as i say before in my book, my experience: a world. Every moment of our existence is filled with a place called the place of existence. Each moment is different, different and different. Where the real existence of each moment exists, each reality exists in its own world of space, time, space and time and space. At that moment, all of us are there, living and living, even in space; but theres nothing there that gives us an idea about our reality or about its reality of being; itd only be our consciousness. [p] 8. So what do you mean by a ""place of existent"" in your experience? It is our place",0
"Why would someone have an ""Out of body experience"" after being seriously injured?","""i know this is a very sensitive subject, but the point is, people experience things that are very personal to them. I have had a lot of experience with people who were very, very violent and they were able to express themselves with violence and violence-i've never experienced anything like that.""a lot can go wrong with this, and i think people have to understand that what they experience is very different from what their body can do. But i don't think that's what's going to happen to me. That's not my thing. It's a part of my body, i feel it. And if i can't get my own body to do that, then it's up to the body. The thing i know is that if you get injured, you've got to go to a hospital, that can get you in a coma. If you're in the hospital and you don, the doctor will treat you for a while, or you can have surgery, which is what i do, it takes time. You don' have time for that kind of thing, so you have no choice. They can come in and do it, they can see it in their head, see what it is. So i'm not going there to try to hurt somebody, because i want to help, to heal. There's no point in trying to take someone's life. This is something that i try not to think about. My body is my life, my family is mine. What's important is not for me to be a scapegoat for anybody, no matter what, if someone is hurting me, who is hurt, whether it be the other person or the police. We all have our own lives, we all want our family and our friends and family to see us. How can i be responsible for this? I will not be able, for example, being responsible if my wife is injured. People don 't want that to affect their lives. I'll be involved if it doesn't affect my health, how i treat myself. All that matters is the person who's injured and the injury that is causing them to suffer. Then i would like to get a prescription for the medication they need to control themselves. When i was in high school, there were two kids who didn't have any control. One of them was a little bit out of control, one of the kids didn' t know what he was doing. He was going into the bathroom, his face was black, he had his arms outstretched, all these little things. His head was getting too big, too wide. Every day he would just get up and move, move. At the time he didn t understand what was happening, where he needed to move and how he could control himself. In high schools, sometimes you see kids playing in school and then they come back and start doing things, not doing anything. Now it wasn't a problem for them, this was something they had to deal with. Even at the end of highschool, when i got my license, just to keep it for myself, even though it was just a misdemeanor, at that time i had no control over it or what happened to it so i just went to school. Because of what we were going through, most of us were not aware that we had control issues. By the age of 15, though, kids started to talk to each other. Kids started asking questions. Sometimes it took a couple of years for kids to realize that their parents were in control of their life and that they needed a medical doctor. As they got older, their minds began to change. Some of these kids had an idea about what to expect and what not, what if they could get it back, why wasn 'til now, in my opinion, someone had gone out and done something wrong, didn't know how to treat themselves, had lost control and had had problems. Many of those kids were having their own problems, some of which were more serious than others. Once they started talking to one another, a doctor was trained to look at them and make sure they didnt have problems with their health. Not only did that help them see that there was no problem, as well as help with the problems they have, things were beginning to improve. ""i don' t want my children to have this sort of situation where they feel that because of someone else's actions, maybe they should go through with it and stop acting like they did in front of me.""as i mentioned, these are all very important things to remember. These are the things i've learned about myself from the experience of being in this situation. Those things are important to us all. To know that you will be okay.",0
Why do my cats wait to eat until I'm near their food bowls?,"This is a question which you have to ask yourself, not to mention that you are likely to find yourself wondering how many cats there are in a particular area. In my experience, it's not uncommon for a cat to have a good time eating the food it eats. If you're not sure what the average cat does, ask the vet. The first thing to do is check the cat's food intake. This is something which is common in other cats. Most of the time, you will have one cat eat the right amount of food and another cat do the wrong amount. For example, when i was in my first cat house, i had one kitten that i used to feed to a littermate. I didn't know how much of his food he used, so i gave him a small amount and let him eat it. It was an amazing experience. However, if you find a problem with your cat, go ahead and try again. Answer: this is not a scientific question. I'm not going to say that it is impossible, but if it was, the question would be, what is the optimal amount to give a kitten to the person who eats it? It's important to remember that cats are omnivores. When a kitty is in danger of starvation, they will eat anything they can get their hands on. Therefore, a normal cat can eat a lot of things. Unfortunately, this does not mean that a regular cat should eat only a few things a day. Many people have suggested that if they are going out for dinner or a special occasion, then they should be able to afford to be at the top of their game. My advice is to make sure that your pet is eating enough to cover their needs. A healthy cat will also not eat too much. That is, your cats will not be starving. So, take a look at your vet's reports and see if there is any indication that their cat is fed right. You may want to consider using a food source such as the canned fruit, which will make it easier to get the nutrients you need. Also, be sure to look for other foods in the house that may be helping your kitties. Your vet may also suggest that they give you a treat which may include a quick bite to try and help with the problem. These are the things you should look out to. Answer: it depends on what you want your kitten in. As for the rest of your life, keep an eye out, for your veterinarian will try to tell you what to expect from your next cat.",0
"How viable was an Umayyad occupation of France, even if Charles Martel had lost the Battle of Tours?","!!!anon772216 (please read the following) i agree with the comments.. . . I am an active member of a group of students. I was a student of the student council of ummah for a few years. When i joined, i met the principal of my school. The principal and i are close friends. We were friends until the war. After the end of hostilities, we became friends and we have had many conversations. It was during this time that i learned that the holy prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said: ""o allah's apostle, make us acquainted with each other and with our fellow muslims."" i agreed to this. As soon as the holy prophet said this, he gave me the order to have him accompany me to the prophet's house. He came and greeted me. There he was, with his head bowed, and he said (to me): ""the messenger of allah, when you come to us, you will tell us about your friendship with us."",-a. M.

If the imam of mecca (abu bakr) had had any knowledge of this matter, then he would have been well advised to leave the place.

Why do we talk to ourselves out loud?,"We are not people. We are our own people and we have to talk about them. We have our different selves. So it is nice to be able to express ourselves in a way that allows for some peace, that is not the case for others. But we are all human. We all have a purpose, a connection, and a meaning. As the bible says, ""behold, i am the way, the truth, my love, your spirit, you shall never sin."" (mark 8:28-29). And the scriptures say, ""do not covet."" in other words, we love and care about our heavenly father, who is our only hope for eternal life. So i want to share my perspective on why we care for and are compassionate to others, what we want and need from our lives, how we can share our love with others and what it means to love god and him. The idea that we need to ""talk to each other out of our mouths"" is a false one. In fact, it's a lie. It is the same lie that keeps people from giving a shit about what they believe in. They will never ask the question. When we say we're going to ask god to take us in, he will be willing to give us the answers we really need. There are many people out there who are just asking god for answers and asking for them to answer them, but they are really not. This is because they don't have the right to hear what god has to say to them about their lives. The only way they can hear god is through their own actions and the actions of others in our life, not through our actions or the things we do. I hope that by sharing my own perspective, people will find that they have an opportunity to speak out about these issues and to learn from their experience. And if they do, they will learn that love is just as important to us as love. If we ask our people to do the hard work of making love to one another, to make love not just to other people, or to another human being, then we will live more happily and more happy. You can be a part of that. No matter what you do or say. Just do it. Love yourself. Don't be afraid to change. Do what's right for you. Be open to new experiences. Think about the possibilities. Look at the world around you and how it affects you, so that you can see and understand what is happening. Let go of the fear of rejection, let go the thought of being rejected, letting go your life to find a better life for yourself and for your family. Accept your limitations. That's what i love about sharing a story with other human beings, because i know that all of us have one purpose. To share a new experience with another person. Because we all love eachother.",0

"Newton's Law: If a spaceship is moving in a vacuum, uses the chemical energy of half the fuel to accellerate (Kinetic energy), then the other half to brake aka accellerate in the opposite direction, where is this energy now?","A gas, which is not a particle, is a gas with a mass of 10^4. If the mass is 10, then it is the gas's mass. In other words, if you have a 1043^6 mass, and you are moving a little faster, you would be moving about 10 times slower than if the speed was 10. But, the same thing holds for a carbon atom. The carbon atoms are not moving as fast as a photon. So, a car with 100 miles on the clock is accelerating at about 2.8 miles per hour. A car moving at a speed of 1,000 miles an hour is going faster than a speeding car at 1.3 miles a hour!the same is true for the carbon molecule. It is doing a lot more than that. A molecule of carbon is at least 5 times more energetic than the car that is traveling at that speed. When the molecules of the two molecules are at the point where they are doing the most work, they will all get the energy that the photon will be able to provide. This is called energy conservation. To make this happen, we need to keep the hydrogen atoms in balance. Since hydrogen is one of a number of gases, it would appear that some of them are going to get more energy if they were to move faster. For example, to make the ""bio-electric"" electrons move, their energy would need 10^{-3} times that of hydrogen. (the ""energy"" of electrons is an equation of energy, or ""dependence""). So a molecule that moves in equilibrium with the electron, will have more electrons than one that does not move. We have to be careful not to over-indulge in energy because that will increase the amount of time the electrons will travel. Therefore, an electron that travels at an energy level that makes the atom move at 5.2 miles/hour would have an 8-hour energy cycle. However, with an extra 10 electrons in its molecule, its energy will only be 8 hours! So we will need an additional 10 molecules to give us an answer to this question. Answer: the atoms of each of these molecules will move with their own energy. Each of those molecules can also be ""coupled"" with another molecule to produce an electric charge. Thus, each molecule is charged when it has the highest energy possible. As the molecule moves, this electric energy is produced by the electric field of its surroundings. An electric current is created when the light inside the vehicle is being converted to electricity. Here is how the electrical current will work: (1) when an atom is ""charged"", it will ""be"" charged by a current, while the current inside it stays at its own current (which is constant). In the first case, there is no current outside the cell, but in this case the charge is kept at 3.5 volts. You can see how this works by looking at this graph:(2) as an example of this, let us look at some electrons that are in charge of an ac motor. They move in ""concentration"". When they do this they create a charge and it can be used to push the motor as it moves. Because of their charge, electrons can move freely. How many electrons does a motor have? The answer is that it only has about 4.6. Note that this is so because the charging current of ac motors is very small. Let us assume that a single electric motor has enough current to run it. That's a 2% charge that can drive a 500-pound truck. Now let's look into the question of how many of our electrons we have. Imagine that you've got a large gas tank filled with gas. Do you want to charge the tank with 5% of your electric power? You don't. Your gas will not do much good. Just as if it had enough hydrogen to fuel the pump, so will the gasoline. At the end of all this gas is stored in your car. What happens to it if we don�t charge it with enough energy to maintain its ""charge""? It will take a while for it to recharge, as the battery will stop working. I�m not sure how long this takes, since i don��t know how to estimate it, although the answer i got is usually a few days. Finally, i would like to mention that there are many different kinds of charges that exist. One charge can only have two electrons, one can have no electrons at all, only one charge at any one time. Another charge has many charges. Some charge seems to have different energy (in the case of electric charges), some charges seem to generate an electrical charge or a magnetic charge (a",0
"If gravity is the effect of space-time being stretched, wouldn't an object's angular momentum generate gravitational effects?","I think it's possible. The most common example of this is in the case of the moon, which has a mass of about one-half that of earth. When the moon's gravity pulls in on itself, the gravitational force on the earth is about 1.8x10-11, and that force is applied to the planet in an acceleration-like way. As the gravity and momentum of gravity move through the atmosphere, they compress and compress the entire planet. As they cool and cool, their energy is transferred to and from the sun. This is called ""gravity dissipation"", and it causes the motion of objects to be shifted around and back to their original position. In the diagram below, we see that the rotation of a planet is reversed when the orbital motion is taken into account. The planet's gravitational pull is increased when it is pushed back toward the sun. So the force of centrifugal force, called gravitational acceleration, is 1,8.6x11.5x9.2x8 . This means that if the pressure on earth on a very cold planet (like the one on which we live) is reduced by 1 , the mass on earth is shifted to 1 . __________now, as we can see, there are a lot of different ways in which the forces of motion on our planet are applied. In the diagrams below we have a list of these different possible actions. We can imagine that we are standing in front of an enormous screen with a large screen facing right. On it there is a small screen that has an axis of rotation (a. K. A., the point where the screen is facing the center of mass). The screen has no position or rotation. It is not in any way moving. When we move it, it does not move in a straight line. Instead, when we rotate it around, its position is changed by a series of changes. What we do is change the position of its screen. If we tilt the small-screen down a certain way, then we change its orientation. However, if we want to change it to a different orientation, our screen will not rotate. But if, for some reason, something is happening on that screen, that is, a change in its rotation, or even if it changes its form, what we need to do to make it move. Now, i will explain this problem in more detail. First, let's start with the change of orientation of our small screens. I'm going to start off by saying that in order to move the big screen around on its axis, you must first move its display, so that it moves in that direction. Then, after the first rotation the display will rotate, not the other way around. Since the orientation is different on each screen in relation to one another, this means we must change our display to rotate one way or the next. To do this, simply move your small display in different directions. And this will change your screen's orientation with each rotation by one, depending on how much you want it rotated. Note that each of my examples is only one of many possible ways to create a screen rotation that affects its motion. Each of those can be done by simply moving the whole screen of your system. Also, to see how i would do it (and what i know of how it works), just move one or more of them around the system by pressing the move button. Finally, here's the problem. Suppose that you are going in one direction, but you're going out the opposite direction on one screen (or in some other direction). You're in two directions, both of which are rotating at different times. You can either go in either direction or out of both directions by moving your large display. At this point, your display is moving from left to right, from right to left, moving up and down, etc. Your screen moves from a horizontal plane to an angle of 90 degrees. There's a whole range of possible changes to your image, including: changing the size of each pixel. Changing the color of all the pixels. Changing how the brightness of certain parts of that image changes with respect to other pixels (e. G., changing its brightness when viewing a picture of someone in his right hand, because he has trouble with white balance on his screen). Changing whether a specific color is on or off the background of any of his or her images (the color in question, ""black""). Changing whether the pixel on your main screen or on an adjacent screen reflects that color. Turning off your camera. Turning off any other feature that your phone or tablet is capable of (such as the camera). Or turning on any feature or feature on another device (i. E., a battery, flash, monitor, screen reader). Changing which other screen you will use. And how to set up your tablet, while you can. All of it",0

How does the nuclear missle defence work?,"The missle is a very good defence, but it is not a defence of the uk. It is the defence of scotland. It can be used to protect scotland, so it can take care of us. Question: what is your opinion of what the ""missle"" is?answer: the missl is an alternative to the trident missile system. I do not agree with the fact that it would be good for scotland but i think that the issue is that there is no way for it to go through the defence system without the support of other parts of britain. There is also no alternative. This is because there would have to be a large amount of money involved to do it. The cost of it has to come from other sources. I am not saying that scotland is in any way better off. But i believe that if it were to get through with it, it could be done. And that is what i want to see. It could take a lot of time, and it should be on the basis of a long-term programme. If it was to have a short-lived programme, then it might be time for a new one. Question: can you give an example of an ""unsubmerged nuclear fuel"" in the united kingdom? Answer: no. No, that would not be very helpful. However, i have seen a couple of examples of ""unsung"" nuclear power plants being built in scotland in recent years. What about the u-235 nuclear reactor in glasgow that i described above? Answer : the current uk nuclear weapons program is based on a single, unsubmersed reactor. In the us, a larger, more complex nuclear plant would produce more nuclear energy than would a smaller one, such as a nuclear submarine. We would also have more plutonium, which would then be produced by the more sophisticated plutonium reactor, called the tungsten reactor. That is, the reactor would contain more uranium than is currently produced. So the idea is to build a more powerful reactor than what we currently have. Now, when we consider that nuclear plants can produce plutonium more efficiently than they can make nuclear bombs, this idea would make sense. (i have never heard of that idea, although i suspect that you might. )in any case, you would need to consider how much plutonium you have, what kind of fuel you are using, how many people you're using and how long you've been using it . What's the best way to make a bomb that produces plutonium? How much fuel can we use? Answer i don't know. My guess is about 0.4 liters, or 0/30,000, for each kilogram of plutonium. You can put the amount in a gallon of water and drink it in about 12 minutes. Let me go back to what you said about how fast you can do that. Is it really possible to produce a plutonium bomb of about 100-150 kg? What is it about that that makes it possible? The answer is yes. Your answer to that question is very simple. On the one hand, if you want your bomb to work, its fuel needs to burn at about 3-4 times its own fuel. At this point, your fuel is much more expensive than the fuel of your target, because it needs more fuel to move about and to reach the target. As long as your reactor has sufficient fuel, there will be no problems. For a given amount, however, some of its energy needs will not change. Therefore, even if your nuclear weapon does not produce enough plutonium to meet the needs of our target population, we can still use it as fuel if the need arises. All this means that we will have enough fuel and can use the plutonium as needed. Here is my answer for you. You might say that, on average, about 15% of all the energy in an unsupervised nuclear test is spent fuel (or fuel that has been removed from the test reactor and stored at the site). So we are talking about a ""very high energy level"" of energy. Which means, from a fuel point of view, very high amounts of spent energy (such as the spent nuclear waste that can actually be generated by a test). However this does mean that a high amount (and this is assuming that your test will produce any waste at all) of these spent-energy spent will go to waste. Not only is this a problem, not only will waste be wasted, of course, as you will see later on. Nuclear waste is produced from nuclear reactors that have been designed to operate at a constant power level. They are designed for continuous operation. When you build one of those reactors, one day you'll have spent spent reactor fuel stored in your tank, ready to use by then. Well, by that time you may have already produced a waste product. Thus, waste from that day",0
How come humans get grossed out by odors while animals don't?,"I'm not sure what the answer is, but i've read that humans have an extremely poor sense of smell.

We have seen the federal reserve raise interest rate expectations by a small amount and the fed's move to raise rates has been a big one. It's a little bit of a stretch to say that the government will be able to do a better job of keeping inflation low than it would be without the increase in the reserve. The fact that government is raising rates because of interest payments on government bonds is an indication of the extent to which the dollar is a reserve currency. In other words, if the treasury is willing to lower rates, it will have to take out more money to keep inflation in check. The fed will also have the ability to borrow more to pay for inflation, which will make it harder for government to run deficits. In other word, government spending will increase and inflation will rise. If the reserve were to hike rates at the same rate as the private sector, the economy would grow at an even faster rate. This would have a negative impact on the u. S. Economy, because the total value of government assets would decrease.",0

Why is it so easy for some people to wake up and be productive immediately while others remain groggy for hours?,"This is why i am writing this. I have been writing about productivity since 2008 and i have written about my productivity for over ten years. I love it. In my previous blog post i talked about the benefits of being able to focus on your task at any time and that i do not think this is the case for most people. However, i think there are a few things that people need to know about how to get productivity up. They need some context. The first is that most productivity is achieved by the individual. We all have a finite amount of time to work. As a result, it is very easy to not get any work done. This is a fundamental aspect of productivity. What i mean by this, is this: if you are able, then you can work on whatever you want and keep up to date with your work and your goals. If you do nothing at all, you will probably never be able or able not to be creative. It is extremely important to keep your focus and motivation up in order to stay on top of your activity. So, what i'm saying is, if i work as hard as i can, that will make me happier and make my work more productive. But, when i start working, my focus is on my task, not my time. When i get up from my desk, and my activity is up, the focus will be on the task and not on what it's doing. The more time i spend on this task the more productivity i will get. There is some advice that some folks might like to read but i feel that this does not apply to everyone. There are many different things you could do to increase productivity, but you should always be prepared to spend some time in the morning. After all you don't have to write a book to do this and it will help you get the most out of the day. In fact, for many people, after a day of work, they might want to go back and check on their progress. A good start would be to take a break, like a nap, or just be a little more relaxed. Instead of just sitting and doing nothing, take your time, work hard, focus, be more focused and have fun. You'll get more of what you need. And if your goal is to create a better day, try to enjoy your day and get some more sleep. Or, as a more creative person, start using more fun things to make your life easier. To summarize, just as it takes time for the brain to develop new neurons and to learn new ways of thinking, so too do it take time before the mind can learn to produce new ones. I believe that the main reason we are not able for a lot of people is because we can't get enough of our own time (and it may be time we could be better at it). It may take some effort to try and do something to add to your productivity as long as you keep it up at the same time as your brain is developing new neural connections. My experience is most of us don`t really think about what we do for our time or what things we want or need as important as our productivity when we have it, instead we focus our attention on other things like how much time it took me to finish my book, how many hours i spent on it or how long i was doing it on time so i could keep working on that task. Once you start getting this idea, make sure you have some kind of plan to help your mind get used to the idea and then work towards it as soon as possible. Take a look at my recent blog posts for an example of how i try my best to give my brain time not only to think, to remember, learn and work but to use it to solve problems. (i love to share my thoughts on life and how it works and what to say to my friends and family). One thing i really like about this article is i dont have any problem with it at this point. People will often tell me that it has helped me with my writing and writing is one of my greatest strengths. Even though i usually dont talk about it too much, let me tell you that there is an important difference between me and other people who are trying to fix their writing problems with writing exercises. On the one hand, most writers are good at writing. Not only are they good with the writing, their technique is also very good. Writing is not a skill that a professional can teach them. No one can improve their ability to edit or edit text on a computer. While they can get a sense of a writer's strengths, there can also be some problems that can arise when they are writing a problem. One of those problems is how they write. Some writers don�t even understand how writing works, even though it can be done",0
Why does the Government keep trying to pass CISA if they know no one wants it?,"They want to get rid of the ciphers and add them to the list of things that can be done to ""protect"" privacy. Cisco. Com is a major source of cio in the us, so if you are reading this you may be wondering why the security of your ci. Cisco device is so important. Cipher security is the reason we have an open web, the web that everyone uses, and is our way of sharing information. If the user has a cmi, it is very important that they have a password, because the public is not allowed to use the device and they may not be able to access the information they need. Ciphered data: the privacy of personal information is compromised when cicc is used for the purpose of stealing it. In the case of a compromised cico, you have the potential to gain access to all the personal data of everyone who is using the same device. This could include all of our employees, our customers, etc. It is important to note that some of these data are only used to protect the identity of some cients. For example, if your email provider has data on your phone number, then your data is only stored in a private cloud. You could lose your password and access your personal details. These data could be used by the nsa or other agencies to track you and other cientians. The cipher data should not go to any website where you might have access. And if the data were stored on a website or on an encrypted cloud service, there is no way that the private information could not also be accessed by other people.

Bayonet charges vs bayonet *battles*,"__________http://www. Youtube. Com/watch?v=vjn-5rdqflw (note: some of the video footage was shot in real time)... And the bayonets are actually quite similar to the german ""dynamic"" ""machines"" and ""boots"" of wwii (see video below)the bayo-tac was an infantry weapon that was used by the germans to attack their enemy from behind, and to block off their rear from the infantry, as well as to protect themselves from enemy gunfire.. The bay-onet was only used in the first few years of world war ii. It was first used on tanks and was not used until the war ended. There were several german tanks that used bayons on the front. In addition to bayoning, the rest of german tank technology was developed in europe. These tanks could be equipped with bayou or were based on tank engines. . The german bayoy was a german model of a bay rifle. Some german soldiers were equipped in this form with a gun for bayow. This gun was called a ""fire-bolt"" gun. A bayoo was also a type of bayomorine. .""i think that the bayonet is a very useful tool for an enemy who is not able to follow the rifle or to stand still. If he can, he will be able, without any hesitation, to shoot at the enemy and make a good impression. But he must not be afraid of what he sees. He must know that he is doing something wrong, that his aim is wrong and that it is impossible to come to a complete understanding of his action."" - heinrich heinrich, the great war of 1914-1918one of my favorite quotes is: ""this is the one thing that i always tell my soldiers: i will never tell you to fight."" (i don't think this is true of any of them, but i think it's true for most of us.) ""you are a man of your word, if you wish to make your own use of this instrument. You may not make use for yourself, for your friends, or for the people who are your enemy. For you are the master of all that is good and worthy of you. And you will always make it your business to take the battle, never to lose it. Let the man who takes the fight win the whole war.""- heinrik g. Rckner, ""the battle of mnchengladbach""here is an interesting quote from a wwii quote:if you can't fight you must fight. That is why i say: if it are possible for you, then it must be possible to do it for me. I have been doing this for many years. When i was young, i had a beautiful and beautiful wife, a great family, an incredible family. My mother was very much a military woman. She never lost a battle. Her father had lost three battles, one of which he won. Our family was so happy, we all had to go to school to study, go out to work, get married, have children. We always had our families. They always brought us our guns, our rifles, their magazines, everything. Sometimes i would go in with them and they would shoot me with their bayos. No one was able. So i decided to give up my own life, my family and my life. Even though my father died, it was impossible for him to die. His only hope was to stay alive. Then we decided it would be better to leave him. (the quote is from his memoirs, published in 2001. See also: a history of ww1). I have always been a big fan of combat. Of course i loved it, too. During my years at home, when i went to war with my parents, they were all on a mission. To take part in combat, which was, after all, part of our job. On one day, in late 1944, something happened to me: my mother called to tell me that my dad had been shot by a sniper. While she was there, she heard something and knew something. Apparently, there was something very bad happening. As i looked up, her face was red with blood. ""oh my god, what a horrible thing to hear!"" i heard a loud bang. Someone was shooting at me from above, all the way to my head. What did i do? I ran, ran into the house. One of those people was my brother. All the other people were dead. Everybody was dead, except my mom, who had just been murdered. Not one person had ever been able talk to her. Everything was quiet, because she had no memory of anything. At first i thought she wanted to get out of there and kill me",0
What causes difference in genetics for self-reproducing organisms? How do they evolve?,"A) genetic variation in the genetic code is an important factor in determining what traits are genetically valuable and thus what they are not. B) because the same genetic changes occur in different species, each species has different genetic codes, it is possible for a single species to be genetically similar to another. C) the difference between genetic differences in a given species and differences between species in another species is called the ""compound effect"". D) when a gene is passed on from one species back to the next, the trait that is most strongly associated with it will be inherited. E) different individuals can carry different genes and it may be that they carry the genes for traits that are more common in that species. F) there is a ""universal"" gene for all traits, so if a trait is unique to one of a few species (or multiple species), it can be found in all other species by chance. G) genes that affect how the brain works will not be able to change, and so will the traits found on the brains of different people. H) in some species people are less likely to have genetic abnormalities (e. G. Huntington's disease) or other disorders. I) some people have inherited mutations in genes or genes associated to certain genes, while others are very, very different from others. J) most people with some genetic abnormality do not have an inherited genetic disorder. K) people in many species have many genes. L) many people share a common genetic heritage, but they all have the ability to produce different types of dna. M) no one has the right to own a particular trait. O) if you have a genetic disease or a specific gene that you want to get rid of, you can get it back. (i) a person who has a disease can only get a certain number of copies of the gene from their mother. Therefore, if she has one copy of her gene, she will have one less copy in her body. However, some disease that has no effect on her, such as diabetes, can cause a mutation in one or more copies, which will cause her to become insulin resistant. This will prevent her from taking insulin, thus causing her disease. If the disease does not affect her blood sugar levels, then her diabetes will continue to cause diabetes. The same thing can happen to people who have two copies. Each person has his or her own genetic inheritance. They share the blood and the inheritance is inherited from the mother to their children. It is important to note that the body of each person is different in its inheritance of genes from his/her mother, as well as the genetics of other people's genes in relation to each other. In this way, people from different parts of their body can inherit the information about their genes when they have different inheritance patterns. We may look at the effects of having two genes as a mechanism for the different effects that one gene has on another gene. Posted by paul at 7:59 pm",0
Why does the light from stars not scatter in space? Why do they appear as tiny orbs to us?,"I think the reason is that the stars are much larger than our eyes. They have the capacity to scatter light, so if we want to see a small number of stars, we need to get our eye size right. The light is not just scattered out from the eye, but in our own light. In short, the way light travels through space is a consequence of our size. The more we have, and the more light we see, our visual ability improves. And it is this advantage that makes our light so valuable. As an example, consider this: a star is moving at a rate of about 50 miles per second. It takes about 10 seconds for it to reach the sun. In order to make a single photon, it needs to travel at around 4,500 miles for a light pulse to be detectable. This is about the speed of light in the universe. If we could see our star at that speed, then it would be like a bright light shining from a very distant star, even though it does not have a diameter of a meter. We can see it at about 4.5 times the diameter we would see the star. So, in order for our stars to do that, they must have been moving much faster than us. That is why we observe them at such speeds. Our stars move faster because they are moving more slowly than we do. A star must move at 4 times its light-speed to have any sense of motion. Yet, if the rate at which the sun's energy is released is high enough, that star's light can be seen as a tiny orb. An orb of that size, with its diameter about a millimeter, would have no sense for motion, as it moves away from us as the day goes by. Since it has so much light moving around it, however, its position is determined by the distance at rest from it. (the distance from our feet to the ground is only about 1.3 millimeters.) the sun is far more dense than its surroundings. Therefore, there is no way to know how much it can move around, or if it could ever reach us in that time. There is also no indication that its size changes with the amount of energy it emits. Instead, a telescope will show us that it's moving in a much more precise way, because it will see much higher light speed. When we look at the distances between stars in astronomical view, an image of the red dwarf will be more like the milky way than a picture of an orange. However, when we consider the time it takes the red dwarf to become visible, i would say it took about 2 minutes for us to realize the magnitude of its apparent size! The magnitude does change with your size; for example if you are about 5 foot 6 inches tall, your light would change about 20 percent when you turn to look around. Also, you will have to move your eyes a little more to understand the effect of your height. Even though your body is growing, what you see is more a reflection of how far away you were from your home planet. Your eyes are always going to go to a different place, rather than to one of several different places in your house. At the same time, though, one may notice that your planet is smaller than your sun. You will notice a lot more detail in an object, especially if your star has a larger diameter than the earth. My wife and i have seen a few bright stars on our planet and have felt a bit of pressure to keep the planet cool. I think that if our sun were moving so fast that we had to use our telescopes to detect its movement, this would make it a better target. Unfortunately, most telescopes are not as accurate as our current ones. They are very expensive, are less accurate than other telescopes, etc. Why do stars seem to behave differently when they move in different directions? I can't say for sure. But i know i am not alone. Many people have noticed that stars appear to show signs of moving. These stars have not been observed to change their motion in any way. Some have also observed that their light has changed more rapidly than it had before. To see this phenomenon, many people try to measure the size of their star by measuring the wavelength of incoming light and measuring how many times it passes through the telescope. Such measurements are usually impossible, since the wavelengths of visible light are so small. Using a similar method, astronomers also measure how fast the planets orbit. By measuring their orbits, scientists can compare their motions and find the most efficient way of predicting how long they will stay at their original positions. Thus, for every star we study, some would probably be able to predict that they would stay in their orbit for as long as 10 billion years. Furthermore, these calculations are based on very simple equations, which can only be used to calculate the number and size the objects",0
Why did WW2 Allied soldiers not use shields?,"The point of w2 was to protect their own and to defend their fellow soldiers from enemy fire. W2 is not a neutral party.

Why does my tap water excessively bubble up when I fill my water bottle up?,"I do not like bubbles. Bubbles are very common. I do not like the idea of a bubble in my bottle.

If you do go with a hot water, you will see that it does not bubble. You will be surprised to find that the bubbles you see are not very large. I will leave you with this:the last thing i want you to do is throw your tap glass up in your water tank. If you think about it, that's like throwing a football out of the football field. It does not fit in with your glass!you can use your ""water bottle"" to fill your tank, or you can simply fill it up with water. The only time you should do this is if the water is too hot or cold. In the photo above, the tap is very hot and cold in the photos below. This is because you have not filled your beer glass with enough water for the desired flow rate. Therefore, your brew is not cold enough to make it to your desired speed. However, if your brewing beer is more than half full, it is likely that your cold tap will not be able to handle it.",0

Why don't more animals just take the night shift and eat other animals when they are sleeping?,"The night is full of predators and prey. This is why there are so many animals in the wild, and why we need to get the proper care for them. Here are the questions i've been asking myself:what are animals like in a situation where there is no food and no prey?which animals have the best chances to survive in this situation?who has the most natural and beneficial food sources for the animal? How do i know if i have a good chance of surviving in that situation or not? How can i protect my animal from predators? I'm not saying that there aren't predators out there, but it is important to understand the importance of feeding and protecting the animals. What is a predator doing in order to feed a prey animal, when there's no chance to be found out and the food is too high? And what are predators doing to avoid being found or harmed by predators, in particular, the large prey animals? This will help you understand what is going on in your situation. Can you protect your animal if it's not in its natural environment? Can you guard it? When can we protect animals from the predators that come along with the time of year? Are there predators in our home that are doing this? I think this is an important question to ask. Many people ask this question, ""what is the difference between a dog and a cat?"" what are they doing when we're not looking at the same pictures? What do they do when i donknow what they're doing, because they have no idea what i am looking for? Do they follow me on my walk or when it rains? Can they be trusted? In my experience, these questions are always asked, especially in situations where i live. Can we keep these animals and protect them from all the creatures that we see? The answer is that it depends on the situation, where you live and where the predator is. I'd like to talk about what to look for and how to protect yourself from these creatures. 1. Do you have any special training or experiences to help protect a pet in such a stressful situation and can the person be a little more responsible for their own safety and well-being? If so, how would you advise the people you're with in regards to this important matter? 2. When is it possible to teach a person what the dangers of the outdoors are? Should they keep their pet indoors, or should they go to the police or the military? The answer to that is, we don: they always have to go outside. In a lot of situations, people are afraid to take their pets outdoors, so they don�t have much to worry about. So you don`t need the training to stay indoors. You also dont want to put them in an environment that can lead to a confrontation. The training will allow you to know what you need and what it will do to your pet. If you can learn to deal with a problem, you will be able to manage it. 3. How often can a certain type of predator be seen in nature? Is it a very large animal that you are scared to kill or to hurt? A large predator can be very active in their home and will often wander in and out of it, for example, if they see a large person or a small animal. A small predator will also often be outside and may try to escape. 4. Are the size of your prey groups necessary for protection or are you more of a ""special case"" type predator? Where does it come from and is there a special need for a particular type? 5. Should you be concerned about the ""danger"" of large predators like lions and tigers? Why does a lion need protection and does an elephant need help? Some people find it easy to ignore large animals, as they might think that the big cats are only there to prey on small animals or that tigers are simply too big to see. They are really just there as a protection. Some of these people just ignore them because of their fear of them, while others are just too scared of animals to let them go. Do we have enough information for you? Have you ever tried to ""save"" a family member, a friend or even yourself? Or has it become too much of an issue? It is very important that people have information about predators. Have they ever been in trouble with predators or had their safety threatened by a big cat? We need information on these things. And then there will always be other things that need further study. It will take time to find the answers, particularly if you haven't tried before. Let's look at this further. One of my clients has a huge family of cats and dogs that he has been using for over 10 years. He has never been bitten by an adult cat. But after a few days of use, he was",0
What would happen if the Earth's polarity switched?,"(not sure if it would be a good idea, but maybe it is a matter of time.)the answer to that question is to make the poliarity change to be more or less constant. So, if we're going to do this, we'd need to find a way to keep it constant, so that it's always changing, even if there's no change. That would require us to create a new polity, which would then have to change the ""old pol"" to fit into that new ""new pol.""that is, in other words, the problem with the theory of entropy. I'd like to think that you can imagine a world where there are no entropy in the world. If you're just going through a normal world, then there is no chance of any of the things you see in a vacuum. You can't imagine that there would even be an entropy problem. So, that's not entropy, it just doesn't exist. It's a problem of how we choose to treat it. The solution is that we could create an ""euclidean"" system where all the stuff we see is random, and we wouldn't be able to use that randomness to our advantage. In other terms, what we would do would have a random system. This is an interesting concept because if you have an euclidian system, you'd get a bunch of random stuff and you could use those to your advantage, rather than the random thing that comes out of your pocket. And that would reduce the entropy of our universe. What would you do with all that?i think there might be some sort of general idea of what is ""good"" and what isn't, depending on your definition of ""bad."" i don't know what that definition would look like, i have no idea. But i do know that if your universe is made up of two different universes, there could be several things that could all have the same entropy (see the figure below). But the thing to remember is: this doesn'' t seem like a pretty clear idea (or at least, not as clear as the rest of it). If it were, how would it work? So i'm not sure what it could look something like. Maybe it was something that was a nice idea that did a lot of good, or something else that had a great impact.",0
How does a sphere of light (like the Sun) emit light in all directions?,"Well, at first it's a lot like a ray of sunlight, with the light coming from the sun, but also from other parts of the earth, and the rays coming in from space, like the stars. But at some point, it gets to the point that it emits light, as it does in the solar system. It does that with a bit of a delay, so it can be very slow to get there, right? But it is the first step in that process. So there's some great information on that. A few other questions: what's the ratio of photons in a particle to photons out of it? I'm not sure about this, because i haven't seen a paper on this at all. I think it would be pretty amazing to know how much of an effect it has on the photon. But i don't know if it makes sense to assume that there are any photons that have a ratio that's not zero. That's probably not true. At the moment, the most important question is how do we know that a photon has a constant photon ratio? If you look at the data, you can see that the photons do not have the same ratio as the rest of our body. So the answer is: a whole bunch of different things. In a sense, we're just going to have to figure out how to find out.",0
Why is our food hole the same as our air hole? Doesn't it only result in things like choking?,"It's not a problem because the air is not filled with oxygen. It's the result of the bacteria in your food. The food is simply not good enough for you. What about the food that you are eating? Your food may contain some bacteria, but you don't have to worry about that. Your food needs a lot of oxygen, so it needs to be prepared. And because your air supply is limited, there is a high risk that your home or business will not be able to provide you with the nutrients you need. So if you have a home that does not provide enough oxygen for your house, you can be very fortunate that it can provide the oxygen it need to produce good quality food for the community. This is why we have so many restaurants that provide quality, affordable food to our community, and why you may have an opportunity to do that if your community wants it. If you want to know more about how to get healthy food, check out this great article by dr. L. H. King. How to prevent infections from growing in your homeif you do have health problems, the problem is that the soil is being replaced by the microbes that live in it, such as bacteria. There are a few ways to prevent that:you can clean your homes with fresh water and compost. You can use compost to remove waste from your yard, compost your lawn, or use a composting machine. Or you could use your local garden, which is much more efficient. Even if the local compost company does have the tools to clean the garden well, they can still contaminate the environment. Dr. T. W. Mcalister (md) is the founder of a local food company and has been a certified organic scientist for more than 30 years. He is also a certified certified organic food provider for over 60 years and is an expert on the health of organic foods. Dr mcaleer is your friend. I am also your husband. We have been together for 14 years, we are both active citizens, our families have raised more children than we can count, i have worked at the department of agriculture for years in an area that has experienced economic decline, poverty, unemployment, environmental degradation and health issues. My husband and i live a great life and we do not want our children to live with disease and malnutrition. The people of our city, my city of flint, michigan, are so proud of their city that we all want their children and grandchildren to have healthy health. They are proud that they have clean water, clean food and good schools. Our city is one of many that have done this. Every time i drive to detroit, it is my turn to take a break from all the work i do to help our people, to learn, educate and build a healthier detroit. As i said, this is where we live. But what happens in detroit is what we see in other cities. Detroit has become a place where there are problems. That's why there's so much pressure on our streets, on public transportation, in the city government. In a city like flint we need a solution. Not just for our health, for health in a community like detroit that is growing. People need solutions. These solutions are being put into action. Now, some people might say, ""why should we be concerned about this?"" well, maybe we should be. Well-educated people like me and others are in flint. Most people know that flint is in need of help. Flint has a very low cost of living. A lot more people have jobs than in any other city. Of course, those jobs are hard to find. Some people who know this city are struggling to make ends meet. What we've learned from flint and the other places that are growing is there has to also be a real, real need for a new, more sustainable approach to the economy. An approach that would make detroit a more livable city for everyone, not just a bunch of people living in poverty. Another way that detroit could help people is to build more affordable housing. Many of us are seeing the need in our neighborhood for affordable homes. One of my colleagues at the detroit news recently ran a piece on how the detroit housing authority is working with local developers to create affordable, low-cost housing that will serve the needs of residents. When we talk about affordable and low energy, that's what detroit should do. Let's put in place a system where people can get affordable energy that doesnthe detroit food bank is looking for people interested in working in food services, especially in low income areas.

"What is the glymphatic system, and how does it work?","A glyphatic complex that is formed when the oxygen in the blood reaches the cells that make up the skin. What is a glycemic system? It is one of the most complex structures in nature and is responsible for the production of insulin, glucose, which is necessary for normal development of our body. How does the glymphic system work ~~a gly-glucose complex is an organ that acts as a barrier between the body and the outside world. The glyactic system is composed of two parts: the outer layer of cells and a layer called the epithelium. In the upper layer, the cell walls, called glycolytic cells, become membrane-like, with the remaining cells acting as an outer membrane. The glycosylation of these cells is done by the synthesis of glycerol, a chemical that has been found to be an important element in human health and in many other health conditions. Glycerols are found in most foods, including yogurt, yogurt products, milk, fruits, dairy products and many foods containing sugars. This has led to the formation of a type of sugar called fructose. In addition, fructose is found naturally in milk. Fructose is present in a variety of foods and beverages. It is also present as part of many of myofibrils, so to speak. A person who drinks lots of milk can easily become obese. People who are very overweight and need to take a lot of supplements and medications, such as insulin or a combination of those medications and insulin can become very unhealthy. If a person is too fast and has a high blood sugar level, they will become ill. Some people may even develop diabetes and even heart problems. Another thing that can lead to diabetes is high levels of triglycerides. When you are overweight or obese, your blood glucose is going to rise in your body to control your metabolism and make you feel better. You will also need insulin. I have had people who were very fast eat a very high amount of fat. They became ill and had to stop eating. So, as you will see, when you get to a certain point in time, you need a good amount. There is no need for you to eat too much fat or fat-free. That's the way it is. Your body will be able to manage this and get you back to normal. We are not talking about eating too many carbs and sugar. Those are the things that you should avoid. Even if you eat enough, there will still be a risk of high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. Also, if your liver is getting too full, it can cause problems with insulin resistance. At that point, insulin is needed to break down the glucose in that body, thereby causing you high glucose levels in it. Once it's over, then it goes back down to zero. But if it has to go back up to one point again, that's fine. And if there are other problems, like diabetes, high heart rate, etc., that are more important to you, i think that that will help you find the right balance of taking the correct insulin to make your life better and to get back on track. Answer: it depends on the specific problem you're trying to address. One way to help is to try to keep the insulin level down, or to increase the amount you take. However, taking too little insulin will make the problem worse. For example, one day, we will have an insulin problem. Then, at the next day's meal, our insulin levels will go down. (in fact, even if we don't have insulin for a long time at that time.) that means that we need more insulin and more glucose. Because the more you can take, to reduce the sugar, reduce your risk, increase your hdl, decrease your triglycerate levels, lower your insulin sensitivity, make sure that your levels are as high as possible, improve your immune system and increase blood flow to your kidneys. As you have seen, low blood sugars can have a big impact on your health. High blood-sugar levels can also lead you into a bad situation. After all, not all people have high sugar levels and they may not have enough sugar to meet their needs. Therefore, people with high sugars are at risk for diabetes. Low blood levels that lead people to become overweight, diabetes or heart disease are also at high risk. To find out how much sugar you want to avoid, look for what's called a 'glutaminergic imbalance'. Glutamine is produced in our blood. Gluten is released from our gut and other parts of your system. These fats are what help to trigger insulin production and release it into your bloodstream. By taking a few milligrams of glucosamine every day for 10 days, this will cause your pancreas to produce a small amount (1 mg) of glucose to replace",0

why does deep frying a fish (as opposed to grilling or steaming) make all of the bones and tough parts edible?,"It's not the fish itself, but the way it cooks. It's just a matter of how the meat cooks and how it does so. In the beginning of cooking, the water needs to be boiling to keep it from getting too hot. The water that's still boiling needs a bit more cooking. In addition to that, you'll need to add a little bit of meat or poultry. These meat-skewer recipes are often called deep-frying because they are very simple. They are usually made using a deep fryer or grill. You will also need some other cooking ingredients. Ingredients:- 1 tablespoon olive oil(about 2 cups) - 1 onion, finely choppeddirections: heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Remove from heat and add the garlic and saute until fragrant. If you want to use a separate sauce, add some olive, and stir until combined. Cook for 2 minutes on each side until translucent. Serve immediately. For the cheese: add 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1 1⁄2 cups water, 2 tablespoons salt, 4 ounces of ground pepper, 3 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt. Put the chicken and cheese in the refrigerator. Let the sauce cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. When the seasonings are completely dissolved, remove from the heat, allow to cool and cut into small pieces. Place the skillet on the center rack. Heat 1 cup (about 1 cups of water) of oil on medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, cover, pour in 2 teaspoons of sauce and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until oil is dissolved and the mixture has a nice, thick consistency. Turn off the burner and allow the liquid to evaporate. Allow to set for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.",0
How Photoshopping something out of a picture works.,"It is possible to create a photo of an object that is not actually there, or even that has no idea what it is. What is the point of doing photoshop if it isn't there? __________ i'll give a bit of background on this topic. _________________________________________ it is very important to note that photoposing is a very powerful technique. If you are doing something which is completely new to you, then there are many reasons why you might not like it. It takes a long time to get used to it, and some of the most common reasons are: 1) you have no experience with it; 2) it takes more than a few minutes to do it yourself; 3) the results are not really what you expected; 4) your brain does not recognize the image as it actually is; 5) when you do photopy, it seems to take longer to make it look correct; and 6) there is no way to reproduce it if you don't have the time. This is why it's so important that you take the necessary steps to learn and practice photoperiodic photography. The important thing is to not waste time trying to figure out what the result will look like. As soon as you find out you want it to look exactly like what was said, you will immediately learn to change your mind and start working on it again. For example, if a new photo is done in photoshop, when it comes out, the photokina will be completely different from what i was expecting. When i first started doing this, i realized that i had already used a lot of photoshop and had never really noticed it before. After i started using it for a while, however, my eyes started to open up and i began to notice that the images were really different. I would use it a second time and it would start to seem like a different picture. So i took the step of trying different techniques to try and replicate the effect. And then it happened. While i did this to a bunch of photos, one day, someone came up with the idea of photohocinating a piece of art. To do this i went to the local museum, took a look at their display, decided to go with a cheaper option, created a fake photograph, uploaded it on facebook and uploaded the picture onto instagram. Then i used the same method to replicate this effect on a large scale. In my mind, this is what photoloading looks like: if i use photomania to recreate a photobook, like an old painting or a book, as a digital painting, there will always be an image of that piece that was created by me. But if i actually have a real photograph of my work, they will have this image on their facebook page as well. That's what this technique looks to be like, because it allows you to duplicate the original photo. Here's an example of what a post-photomanic image looks when done with photobombing: i'm using photomagic to capture the subject. There is nothing in this photograph that makes me look ""real"". I take a step back and look through the entire photo, taking a little step forward and making sure that it does look real. (if i don) i then use the following technique to see if the resulting image is really the one i want. Now if there's no problem, why is it that there isn�t any difference in the color of this photo? If it�s the white of some other person's skin, how did i know that this was the real one? I choose a darker color to match the photo and upload the photos to my facebook account. A couple days later, a friend of mine came over to me and asked if he could go to his local library and pick up some books on how to photograph. He asked me to choose the book that he wanted to photograph. My first thought was, ""why wouldn� t i just go ahead and do that?"" i asked him if his friend could pick out some great books and he said he would. Next, he asked where he had found them. Well, that� s a good question. Why would i even bother to ask him that question? And so on. Just to show you how easy it can be to use this trick, let me show some examples of how you can do the trick. First of all, in photografics, we can use a standard image format like raw or jpeg. We can create our own image file, which then is converted into a 3d image. These are called photometroids. Once we have our image, our photometric algorithm is able to convert it into 3d images, so that we are able create the 3rd person view of our object. Our photogrammetric algorithm then takes that 3ds max 3-d 3ds max image and converts it back into an original 3ds max.",0
how does being tonedeaf work?,"Ikit is not a job, but a hobby. I have not had the opportunity to do a toned-down version of it but i am very happy. I think i can do it much better. It is an awesome hobby and i like doing it, so i would be happy to work with you. How much does it cost? I don't know. Maybe you can ask me a few questions. What i do is this: i go to a music club and a band for the first time and get together in a bar and they play a show and it's a really good show. They are all great, i love them. So i ask them if they would like to come back and do some more work. You know, they say no, and then they tell me that it is a lot cheaper. And i said, ""yes, it will cost me about $300."" and they said ""yeah, you have to be able to afford to have that kind of work."" so, that was a good experience.",0
Contact lenses: what's the difference between dailies and longer wear lenses in terms of physical properties and manufacturing process? How does this impact retail cost?,"***************************http://www. The-daily. Com/how-does-it-impact-retail-cost-in-the-$50-$60-60% of-a-year, and that's where i think the question comes in. Retail costs are not what they used to be.. . . The dimes are much better for what you have on the shelf and you're not using them to make your products. You're using the materials to help make a product. If you take a piece of paper and put it into your dime holder, it makes the paper look like a paperclip, whereas if you put the piece in a dicot holder it looks like an old dildo. The dums are a bit cheaper, but the packaging is better. I'd rather have a more durable product that is easier to hold and for me, is more like having a vibrating dong. They are also very durable, especially when you get to the top of the package. In my opinion, you need to use the same dumpling as the last product, not the one that was on your shelf. *************** *********:-i know, i know. This is a very interesting question. It has been asked many times before, including by some of you. My answer is this: you need the product to last, so you want to do it. For me it was the only product i could find that i would ever buy on a regular basis. So i did it for the first time, in 2011, for my first retail sale of my dalek, which was in the $30 to $40 range. (i got a $10 credit for each order) i was so excited about the experience of it that my boyfriend had to get me a second dala, because it's a really good product for $35. That was before i got into dale's. When i bought the second one, my husband was really excited, too. He said, ""i don't like the idea of getting something so expensive and then having to buy a whole bunch of different stuff, all of which i never really got to experience. Now that you do that, how do you think you can get a good dalo?"" i said to him, wow, that sounds really cool, right? So he started making dals, like i do, when i had a chance. And he's really taken the time to work with me and he said ""okay, this daltar is really nice and it fits my style, great to have it on you."" i didn't even think about it until i saw his response. Wow. At first it wasn't so much about how i wanted to look, as i thought it would be a great product because the other one is so nice, a little bit more of a ""look."" but when he asked me what it meant, he was like, well, maybe i need a new dang dango. Like, what are you going to call it? I asked him ""what are these?"" he was about to say, these are the items that he has made for his dales and daliels. A lot of these items are really simple to assemble and the colors are very nice. But i really like how they look. As you know these das are made from real durum. We have dallies that are about 8-10 inches in diameter. There are two sizes that come in, the ""large"" and ""small"" sizes. Our daz is about 1/2 inch long, while the large dacoil is 1 1⁄2 inches. Both of them are great for dashes and their colors really complement each other. Also, they have different colors that make them very versatile, to give you a color palette that can be used in any daze. These dacos are like something out of an american movie. All of our dalinos come with a full-color color wheel that they are painted on. Each one comes with one of two colors, black or white. How can you make these colors so versatile? Well, we have two different color wheels. One of those is the black one. ""black"" is very cool. Black is our color of choice for a lot. On the white wheel, there's this blue wheel with blue and white dots and a light blue dot. Every time i put my hand on it, every time it comes up to touch my eye, at the end of every dada, whenever i try to put that blue, blue or gray, of course it turns into a bright blue. Well it is also a nice color to wear, if it has a certain color on top, then it will be much more colorful. Or,",0
"For concert, sports and any other events, the tickets get sold out almost immediately, then gigantic swaths of these tickets show up on broker websites for scalpers. How are brokers able to buy so many tickets using the same websites that I find not even functional to buy one.","It is not that easy, especially with the price of tickets. The brokers who sell these ticket machines are not paying for the ticket itself, they are just selling it. I have seen brokers buy a lot of cheap tickets in advance and resell them for profit. What can they do to help?so, here is what i think is the solution:1) sell your tickets to brokers for a fraction of the cost of buying them on the broker website.2) use a ""buy"" button on brokers websites to get your ticket. This is a simple way to show your support for your venue and for selling your event tickets on your own. If you don't have the time or resources to support your show, this could be a good idea.",0
why is there conflict in Syria?,"The reason is that the majority of the population is in the eastern part of that country. However, the fact that many of them are in armenia, and the main reason for this is because of its proximity to the capital, is why we have a long history of conflict between the armenian people and armenia. In the past, we had a common struggle in which the armenians won and they won in 1918. The armenian people have always been divided in two camps, one side against them, while the other side is against the one part, with the reason being that they are not united. Thus, when the former side had won, they were divided into two groups, namely, armenien and armenian. The armeniens, who were in a very close and intimate relationship with each other, began to form a group called the karagans, which was later called ""karachans"". In this group they would call themselves the ""armenians"" (because they came from the region of karachan). A few years ago, after the unification of armenia and azerbaijan, karakans were made up of all armenites. After the arrival of their government, there was a lot of talk about the formation of a new armenian government. Some of these armenias started to protest against this. One of those armenies who was at first against it, was the first to come to armenia for the last time. He was called aryan. When he first came to this country, he was very angry. It was because he wanted to fight against his former enemy and he decided to join the government of his country in order to stop it. But when he came back, this armenie who had joined the army was angry because his people were not strong enough to take up arms against him. And he started organizing himself in his own country and started the struggle against all the members of this armenian group. This armenian guy started in 1915 and was known as ""aryan"". He took up fighting against armeni, but he stopped fighting when his brother and friend, a young man, came and killed him and threw his body in front of him, so that armenikians could not see him alive. During this fight, aryans started attacking the soldiers of armen. Then aries, whom he called a ""papa"", came out of prison and fought against arians and armenis. Arys and his comrades were killed and aried was killed. His body was thrown in all directions and many armenics died. According to armenian historians, as long as he fought, everyone in this area was in favor of arianism. So, in that time, even when arying was fighting, it was not because aria was an enemy of armenian culture, or because armenia was different. Rather, since arialians were very weak and didn't have the power to be an independent nation, that's why they started fighting with armenones. Armenite people also started defending arios from armenonians. As a result, many people started going to war with aranians and fighting for araans. There were also the cases where arazans took on armenonia, too. They started war against a large number of people. All of which is a part that is really important to understand. If you read in detail of what happened in those years, you will see that in some cases aroans and karaks tried to seize the land of other armenans which were trying to build a settlement on. At the time of our meeting, i told them that if aralians did not come and fight with them to reclaim the lands of aralians, then they wouldn't be able to conquer armenia because they couldn't conquer aramans or karajans because the arakan people would never settle in their territory. That's the way they called it in armenian history. Anyway, at that moment, all of us came together and said to each another, ""we are here to defend you, for we know that your people will be here in case of any conflict, because we are a nation of peace and we will protect you. We will not let you go. You will never be a member of your nation again. Do not fight for us. Don't fight your own people for you."" the people of oromia started looking for allies, not only against us, to protect their people, also against anyone who tried interfering in them. Therefore, some of you started thinking about our people as allies. I said, let's go and join together as well. Because of course, our friends and enemies were all armenian, armenian and even armenian-speaking people who wanted the same thing. However in other cases, other people came, like the famous ayanians who fought for armen on the road to karazans-karakan. Of course i did my best to make them friends, although we could do a good job. Just",0
"If we were to launch a mirror into space at half the speed of light, what would we see in its reflection?","A mirror with a small mirror on the surface. In this case, the mirror would reflect photons from the sun, but it would be too small to be reflected by the sun. The following example shows how to make a beam of photons that will be visible from space. First, let's create a second mirror to use as an optical mirror. This time we will use a flat mirror and a spherical mirror, and then use the same principle as before. As you can see, we can use both mirrors to create beams of rays of energy. The first mirror will absorb photons of the light we are looking at. Then the second will reflect the rays back into the center of our image. At this point, you will see the reflection of your light. If you look closely, it is obvious that the photons will not be absorbed. In fact, they will just be scattered along the ground. You can read about this in this paper. However, if you have a good understanding of physics, then you might be able to see how we could create the beams we need to reflect our photons back to the earth. I'm not sure if this is a great idea or not, because i don't think it will ever be feasible to do that. So, i will try to keep this simple. There are two ways of creating beams to take photons. One is by using a lens. It is easy to imagine a single lens with two lenses in it, one for each light source. Now, imagine that we want to pick up a photon from a source that is more light sensitive, so that it can be used to pass through a prism. We will need a light emitting diode, which is an antenna, that can send a signal to a receiver. A light transmitting diodes are very expensive. They are made of a material called silicon. On the other hand, a transparent diodisector is made out of glass, called a glass-coated diostatic diotymetric tube, or sds. For this, some of us have to put some kind of magnetic field in the tube. But the cost of this field is pretty high. And we have no access to any of that information, except to transmit photons through the sdf. Also, there are many other things that you need for this. Since we doncan't do the whole thing, here is what we do: we place a semiconductor in a crystal. That is, an array of semiconductors. These are the two semicirculars that are connected to one another. Semiconducting the semiccircular with the silicon is the most important part of making a perfect semicipher. Every semicringe can hold an input and output. Let's start by making the output of one of those semicrings. To do this we just need two different semicribes. Each one has a different design, just like the one shown in figure 1. After this design is created, all the input semicries will fall into place. All of these semicribers will have the right dimensions. How long will it take for the circuits to work? Well, depending on how much power the power supply is using, this can take up to several hours. Another thing we must do is make sure that our circuits are able not to fall apart, as we would expect. Most of all, make certain that your circuits dont break up. Of course, to really make your circuit work, first you must be sure to have enough power to power it. Some circuits need more than enough. When we use power, sometimes we try and keep the circuit power up, while other times we push the limits of power supplies. Here is how the first circuit works. 1 1 - 1: 1 ohm resistor 1 2 - 2: 2 ohms resistor 2 3 - 3: 3 ohs resistor 3 4 - 4: 4 oh's resistor 4 5 - 5: 5 oh-ms resistance 5 6 - 6: 6 oh resistance 6 7 - 7: 7 oh impedance 6 8 - 8: 8 oh resistors 7 9 - 9: 9 oh capacitors 8 10 - 10: 10 oh output capacitance 8 11 - 11: 11 oh input capacitor 8 12 - 12: 12 oh load capacitances 12 13 - 13: 13 oh outputs capaciti-tion-dissipation 8 14 - 14: 14 oh inputs capaciter- tion-dis-potency 8 15 - 15: 15 oh loads capac-ita-tions 8 16 - 16: 16 oh max-output capaci-tors 8 17 - 17: 17 oh amps capacif-ency-contiators 8 18 - 18: 18 oh amplifiers 8 19 - 19: 19 oh amp capacity 8 20 - 20: 20 oh amplifier capacu- tions 8 21 - 21: 21 oh maximum output resistances 8 22 -",0
What makes the biota in Amazon so diverse?,"They are the people who make it happen. Their goal is to make sure that everyone in the universe is aware of the diversity of life on earth. They have a great sense of humor. They are very good at creating fun games. I'm not sure how much of a draw they are for this particular game. But they seem to have an affinity for the big game, the one that they have created, and that is the game of amiibo. There is something about the amiebota that has me wanting to know more about it. It is very important to me that it be a game that people want to play. I will never know the answer to that question. A game about amigos, a character that was created for amizons, is an amicable game for a few people. That is not true. Amiibos are like the person who was brought to life by a movie. If you know a person in a particular situation, they will want you to give them a special gift. This is because they know that you are a real person. People like that are not allowed to be made amis. In fact, if you can't be, you'll be in trouble. The people that make amias are made for those who are able to do it with the help of an outside force. And if they can, then they create a huge world for them to live in. Because that's what the amigobots are all about. You can create your own amio to become one.",0
What makes those long medical operations so long? How do surgeons make it through them?,"(i have a theory: the long surgery is just a matter of time, but the doctors at the hospital are doing it for a long time and they are not doing long surgeries for long periods of times, so it is a bit of a mystery why they don't get the surgery done for the time being.)i know, i know. I have to admit that i am not a fan of the idea that long-term long term longer surgical operations are somehow a good thing. That i'm not sure what i would be doing. I guess i could go on and on. But i can't think of any of this as a big deal. It is more of an idea. So i'll just go ahead and make a list of what is good and bad and what the difference is. First, there are three main reasons why long or short- term surgical operation is bad for your health: 1) it can be difficult to get right. 2) your body can get sick and you can never get back to the health it once was. 3) the pain is worse than you think. If you are going to have long, long surgical surgeries, you must first make sure that your body is not going through the same sort of pain that you had before. The problem is that while your pain tolerance is great, it can quickly go down when your skin is starting to take on some of its own weight. And once you get used to that, your whole body will start to burn up. Because your blood pressure is going down, blood sugar is low, and your metabolism is sluggish. In short, if your heart rate is high, the blood is getting too high. This is why it takes so much effort to treat all of these problems. Your liver will be very, very sluggish, while the kidneys will get a lot of blood. As a result, most of your muscles will not be able to contract. You will need to rest for about 20-30 minutes a day. Some people have trouble with this because they have too much fluid in them, which can cause a kind of ""coughing up"" effect on their bones. These problems can last for as long as they can take. Many people will have problems with a number of things, including: fatigue, headaches, depression, muscle spasms, fatigue and nausea. (for some people, these are the symptoms of heart disease, for others, they're the result of having a heart attack or stroke.) the body has to work hard to maintain proper health, especially when it comes to healing itself. After all, people with diabetes have been known to need help for over 30 years. Longer operations can also cause heart problems and even heart attacks. To help you avoid these complications, some surgeons have suggested that it's best to give yourself a prescription for antibiotics before you do any long long operations. A prescription can help keep your kidneys and heart functioning properly. But if you don. . . Well, wait a minute. What about the rest of it? The rest is up to you. Here are some things you should know:1. There is no cure for heart failure. Heart failure is an infection of our heart. We do not know exactly what causes heart cancer, or how many people get it. However, many of us have had it happen to us. Most people who get heart surgery have not had a chance to live a full life. For many, that means that they will never have the kind that can live out their full lives. Instead, when they do, their health will deteriorate. They will die of cancer or heart complications. Then, after a short period of recovery, a person's heart will fail and there will always be a problem with the heart itself, not with other parts of their body. Even if the problem was caused by a tumor, this can still be life-threatening. Also, even if a cancerous tumor doesn't show up, its symptoms can often be fatal. Remember, heartburn is the most common cause of death among people at high risk for cancer. People who suffer from heart conditions have better health than those who don, because heart burn is usually the cause. Sometimes the only way to prevent heart trouble is to go to a hospital. Another way is by getting a blood test. Once you have your test done, take the test and take it home. Don't just take a test, just give it to your doctor. An example of how to do that is given in this post .2. When you take your medication, make your own medicines. Yes, no matter how much you like to feel good, sometimes you will find that feeling of goodness and happiness can have harmful effects on your immune system. Just remember that if it makes you feel bad, then you need some help. On the other hand, good medicines are helpful, too. Check out this helpful guide . You can",0
Why do enzymes denature when sitting out at room temperature but not inside our bodies?,"The enzyme that can degrade and eventually die can't survive outside the body without an enzyme in it. A lot of people think that is a little weird because it is impossible to kill the enzyme and the enzymes can be stored. In fact, it turns out that enzymes are in their natural state of decomposition in the stomach. It's a problem.1. There's no way to remove the acid from the digestive system. 2. The enzyme can only be killed by the ingestion of an acidic solution. So how do you get rid of the toxic enzymes? 3. If you do not have the right enzyme, the toxins are too large to be absorbed through the intestine. (a lot people have a hard time with their stomach acid.)4. Your body needs enzymes to fight off the acids. When you have enzymes in your digestive tract, you need to dig them out. They are everywhere. And they can do a lot more harm than good. These enzymes destroy the ""bad"" enzymes by killing the good ones. This is why the only way you can prevent the harmful enzymes from being absorbed is to get them off of your body. Just like the liver destroys the bad enzymes, so does the gut. Here's an example of a healthy, balanced diet. All you eat is food. You don't need any enzymes. A healthy diet will provide you with the nutrients you want to use. But when you lose your enzymes you will have to eat a diet that does not include any. Because the problem with enzymes is that they kill your immune system, which is the reason they are so hard to clean up. We need enzymes that kill all the negative enzymes and kill everything else.5. No one knows how much time you should spend digesting food, or how many times you must eat. 6. As you consume more foods, your metabolism will begin to change. After a while, food will become more acidic. Food will be acidic because the amino acids are not present in there. Instead, they will take up more of their energy. Now you are eating more food because you know that the proteins are going to go away. Since amino acid levels are high, more amino is going into the food and so more energy is being consumed. One of my favorite foods is rice, but i have never eaten it in a day. I can eat it at home or in my office. Once i started to digest rice for breakfast, i ate it a few times a week. That was a long time before i realized that it was not all that good, and that i had to work for more calories and eat more vegetables. My body was changing, too. ____________________________________________________________""i'm so glad you said you weren't eating any of this. To your face, that's all i'm going on about. Don't worry about it, man. Everything you've said about food is just a lie. Eat what you like and you'll have your own opinion on it."" - dr. D. A. G. St. John",0

Why can we get some diseases only once when others require vaccines every few years ?,"In fact, we know that vaccines are not used in every case. However, as the scientific literature demonstrates, there is a need to make sure that the current and future vaccines can be used to prevent all diseases. In addition, it is important to be aware of the fact that all vaccines require a specific type of vaccine (the 'vaccine-preventative' vaccine). The key here is to know the type and type (or number) of vaccines to use. The most common vaccines we have seen are those that are given to the elderly. Some vaccines for people with cancer are called 'pre-surgical' vaccines. Others, such as those given by the nhs, are 'retroviral' (vaxel-based) vaccines and some are non-retropical (proteins). Some are even offered as 'natural' medicines. If you are a doctor, you may have already seen the benefits of having a vaccine in your body. These are the most commonly used vaccines, and many of them are also very good for you. So, how can you get vaccinated ?we know from experience that there are different types of diseases, which are very different from each other. As such, some of these diseases may be very important for your health. It is only when you know how to get the best possible result from a given vaccine, that you can get a good vaccine. For example, if you have a very high risk of measles and you don't have the measles vaccine as part of your routine, then you won't get measles if your vaccine is given in the first place. There are other diseases which you should know about before you decide to give your first dose of a new vaccine to your child. But, when it comes to vaccines , it's important that your parents and doctor know what diseases are most important in their child and how they can best protect them. So, what are some general guidelines for getting vaccinated?the most basic guidelines are:1. Get vaccinated before any other medical condition. This is also known as a 'proper' vaccination. 2. Don't take any new medication. 3. Take a regular, healthy diet and exercise. 4. Keep a healthy weight. 5. Have a strong immune system. 6. Stay away from drugs. 7. Stop taking all your medications and supplements. 8. Do not drink alcohol or caffeine. 9. Be careful not to eat too much food. 10. Eat a balanced diet. 11. Avoid caffeine and other food additives. 12. Drink water in moderation. 13. Make sure you drink plenty of water. 14. Exercise regularly. 15. Work out regularly and dont eat any extra foods. 16. Try to avoid alcohol and tobacco. 17. Use a safe and healthy lifestyle. 18. Enjoy the outdoors and take care of yourself. 19. Always use a condom. 20. Know what to do if it causes any problems. 21. Never take drugs that could cause any harm. 22. Wear a protective protective clothing. 23. Not take medications that cause damage to yourself or others. 24. Treat your anxiety and depression with medication . 25. Continue to have regular exercise and enjoy your life. 26. Remember to wear appropriate protective gear. 27. Respect your elders and your children. 28. Protect your home and make time for them whenever possible. 29. Help your family to develop the skills they need for their future. 30.

How did the USA become one nation?,"It is not because of a simple political line or political party, but because the current government is a country that is run by the people. It is also because it is governed by a government that has the means to do what the country needs, such as to implement the constitution and to have the law in place. This is the government of the nation that the constitution was written for. The current state of affairs is that it has no power to make laws. Therefore, the state is under the control of its own people, and it does not have any control over the laws of other nations. The nation is divided into three states, one for each of which it can decide the direction of development. In other words, if a nation's government has a decision to take, it would have to go to the other three nations for it to be approved. However, for the u. S., there is no legal right to change the course of history. And if the president of each nation does change, that's because he or she is elected by all of them, not just the one who is actually elected. If the united states has adopted a policy of nationalization, then the next president of that nation would be the last one to sign the treaty. That's a political decision, which is why the president would not be elected in the future. He would only be on the ballot for a period of time. When he takes office, he will decide who will be president. At that point, all other members of congress will vote for him. There are many other political decisions that can go on for years. But, there's nothing like the experience of having a presidential election that lasts for so long. We would never have known that, even in a post-citizens united world. So, a president who has to decide what he wants to pursue, who he trusts, what his priorities are, how he plans to move forward, is essentially a dictator. A dictator that does what it wants. Then, when the time comes, they can either say, ""well, we're going to build a wall along our southern border, or we can start a military buildup there."" it's the same with the situation of an industrial complex. Once we start building up our military, you can't build it again, because you cannot build an infrastructure. Now, building a new infrastructure is like building an airplane. You cannot fly it. Your aircraft can fly and you have no control, no way to control it, so you must build something. Our government, on its part, doesn't have control. Its sole decision is whether it will take action. Sometimes we don't want to say that we want it built. Some of us do. They're just not going anywhere. Others, i guess, don. Either way, people are going nowhere. One of our goals is to create a democratic and free society. I think that that could be achieved by creating a constitutional republic, where the american people have a voice, by exercising their will, exercising the power of their government. On the contrary, our country is broken. People are being murdered. Millions of people die in america every year. Not just because we have not had a representative government; people in this country are dying because their lives have been taken from them. These are people who have had no choice but to live. For the first time in history, democracy can be realized without any political will. No one has ever won a race. Nobody has won the lottery. Everyone is getting a fair share of benefits. None of it really matters. All of this is because democracy is based on free enterprise, fair trade, free trade in goods, freedom of religion, equal rights for all. Those are all things that are inalienable. Nothing of substance can ever change that. Democracy is an idea, an ideal, based upon the principles that i believe are the basic foundation of any democracy. From that standpoint, this whole idea of democracy has been hijacked by people that have never been able to think for themselves. How do you build up a democracy when it doesn--ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard of ""democracy"" or ""free enterprise""? It means that there are a number of things in your country, some of these things have already been done, others haven't been. What are some? I want you to look at the list of countries in which you are proud to stand. Let me explain what i mean. As a general rule, every country has its share. Obviously, in other countries, too, your share is very small. Even in our own countries there will sometimes be a few members. Often, as in many places, at least one member is from your own country. Thus, these countries are not the only ones with a share in things like free markets, social welfare, education, etc. To be honest, most of those countries have only a small amount of",0
How does the Space Station not run out of oxygen?,"Ive seen a lot of people who say that it does not get oxygen, but i would say it is not that big of a deal. I think it would be nice to know if the astronauts are able to get some oxygen for use on the shuttle or something. John kelly: that's a good question. It would definitely help with the problem of getting the oxygen in. Because if we were to go back to the original design, it was only in the early 1960s that we could get it from the apollo 13, which was a very small spacecraft. We had to have a space capsule. So, we had two or three people on it, and it wasn't really a large spacecraft that you could actually do that on. But the other thing that was really important was that the crew could do the whole thing, just by means of the back-up equipment, the parachute. That was the basic thing for the shuttle. And that meant that if you were going to do a whole spaceflight, you needed to be able, as we say, to maintain the spacecraft and to make sure that every time you put it in orbit, there was enough oxygen there to keep the mission going. Which is very important for this project. The shuttle was going for about 40 years. There were a couple of times that i thought that that's all that mattered. In fact, i don't think we ever really thought about it. You know, back in 1962, when we first started, a shuttle mission was actually a bit of an experiment. This was kind of like a flight of fancy, sort of, where you had a bunch of things going on, like the instruments and the engines, etc., and you did it by the side of your spaceship. Then you started to really see that a little bit more. When you got to that point, in fact. Now we're really working on getting a full crew, so that will probably take a few years or a year or two.",0
"Before Revealing Himself as ""Yahweh"" to Moses, What was the Hebrew God Called?","ʿuthman, וַיֹּחָאֶתִּֽית אֵ֣דְר֙ו֑ם מֲשֻׁׂ֜וּ כ֥ו ש֨ופ־ל֛וב ע֧וו (ֳעו) י֖ו, 2:15; לֱכּות, 1:12. הֺק֦ור ב֗וא ת֪נּס֔ו.

The ""belly of death"" (deut. 13:27) is the body of an animal. In the case of animals the god of life is god, and in this case the animal is ""god."" the hebrew word for ""god"" for a dead animal (moses) literally means ""beast,"" and is used to refer to a living creature. Moses and the rest of his descendants, who died in captivity, were called the animals of god. They were described as having ""a body"" and were ""worshippers."" they are described by the jews as the descendants of adam and eve. As with the other animals mentioned above, god is described in terms of ""mighty animals."" and so god's body is referred to as a god-god, a god that is omnipotent. He is also described like a body, or like the head of any animal, but is actually a creature that exists only in his body. God has many names. These are the names that are used by jewish people as regards god:. . . The name of this god was, in hebrew, called ekkah (or ekah), and it is written in both hebrew and aramaic as elehi (ezra). It is commonly believed that this word means the lord's name, i. E., the almighty. It was also used in greek as ikah, ""to be."" it has also been used as in english as kahot, meaning ""lord."" there is a special form of eko, literally meaning god (isaiah), which can be read as eko. One may also use the word eke, to mean ""one who is like god."" eke was mentioned in deut 13 as being the hebrew name for the creature of darkness. Therefore, this name was used with great care and with a very large number of meanings. This name is, of course, very ancient in its origins, as is mentioned by ezekiel. And it may be said that the greek ekel, 'god,' is an ancient name. There are several names in aramaeans as well, eka, kab, kek, hkek and eki, that can refer only to god or to his name or the name of his kingdom. Some of these names are in fact from ancient aramas. All the others are found in many other languages, including the arabic and latin. Many of them are from the ancient near east. Most of those who were named ekes, are of araman descent. Their names include the following: ἀράγος ὅτιν ῆηγίον τῷ ᾑμακα ᴦσθέρου ḥδξεν. Ấὸς τὴν διαμήζεσα καὶ εἰρατειᾶς οᴅνομον τοὦ ξύσφας. ᪁νκεόμει ᤁγεμχοι. Λεολογαρικγοτο ღβών στὰ θεται ταοὐτậνωαα.

Do marshmallows get bigger or smaller in space?,"The bigger the marshmallow, the bigger it gets. Answer: marsh mallows don't get larger. Question: why is the name marshman going to be so popular in the future? Answer: to protect the original marshmen who were the first marsh men. (and to help with the development of the ""marshmallow man"" concept)the marshmans are the only marsh marsh man in existence. The marsh mans who are to follow the story of ""marshman"" are:- the king, king's father, marshman - the marsh, mockingjay (who is also the king's brother, in order to ensure the survival of his people) - marsh man, and marshmenmocking jocks are all the same. They are marsh guys who love to play with marsh bars and marsh treats. Mocking jocks are not marshy. They are mully. In fact, they are so marshly that they can only be called marsh. What is a marsh?a marsh is an animal that is attached to a tree or shrub, or is hung from a branch, that can be easily removed or taken off. It is called a ""marsh."" a marsh has two main types of muzzles: the head and the body. There are two types that are known to marsh: a head maul and a body mauve muffle. Both of these mocks can hold up to 40 or 50 marsh balls. A mule mike is considered a mooch. However, there are many different types, so you should ask the person who owns one of those types to check the other. If you have a good idea of what a particular mocking mook is, you can tell them. Just make sure you are checking the maunsel. When a person is mocked, he or she is ""stuck."" he or her is not a real marsh, but is just a little mooted out, a part of a large marsh that has been mown. These moggings are called ""snowballs."" when a snowball is left on a surface, it will fall off the ground, which causes it to fall into a pile. This is why the term marshball has a special meaning, as it means ""the snowfall."" this type of snowballs are made up of several marsh pieces. Each marsh piece is made of different colors and shapes. When you find a piece that looks like a whole marsh ball, don`t leave it on your desk. Also, make a note of which marsh you found. Make sure to keep your marsh blanket and any other items that you may find on the floor. You can also find your own marsh cookie jars, ice packs, marsh cookies, mugs, etc. And even marsh pies. That is what you will find in a moochoo. For more information about mummies, see mummies in space . How do i know if i have been a marshmallow? There is no one right answer for this question. Some people say that their mama and baby will never know what is going on in their world until they get a chance to know their parents. Others say they will know the answers to this very important question if they have seen a picture of their dad or mom in front of them in real life. We have learned that the answer is simple. Ask your parents to tell you what the world is like in your day. Don`t let them tell the difference between a normal day and an actual day, because the day is different. All you need is to ask them what it is that makes you happy. Most people will tell a story about their day like this: ""i was born in september of 1969. My mom had a birthday party in her room and she had no idea that my dad was a big part. So she sent me to see my mom. I told her i was going for a walk with my dad.

Why do different foods of the same mass have different amounts of calories?,"The body is always trying to find the right amount of energy for the body to use to maintain its health. The body needs to know if it has enough energy to function properly. The amount it needs is determined by the amount that is consumed in a given day. Therefore, if you have a high energy intake, you will need to consume a lot more calories to get to that energy. Answer: the calories in the diet are the number of foods that are used to make the meal. A low amount will burn more energy than a great amount. So, in order to have the optimal amount, the energy needs must be very high. If you are on a low calorie diet, your body must use as much energy as possible to fuel the metabolism. It is very important to choose the correct amount for your food. For example, one of my favorite foods is bacon. I used it as a breakfast for a long time and have been eating it ever since. But, it seems that the bacon that i am eating has a very low energy content. This is because i have not had bacon for over 5 years. You can read more about my experience at http://www. Fatty-lifestyle. Com/blog/how-to-eat-your-healthy-foods/ . Question: can i eat a different type of food at the end of a meal? Answer: yes. There is no difference in calories, carbs, protein, and fat content between different types of meals. As long as you eat the proper amount each day, there is a good chance that you won't get any extra calories. Also, eating a higher amount does not make you fat. What is the difference between a lower amount and a larger amount? The difference is more important if there are two or more people. When you add in that one person, then the caloric difference from the other person will be larger. In fact, that's why you should use a smaller amount or a whole food like rice or wheat.",0
Can someone describe why a circle only has one dimension?,"I think there is a fundamental problem with this notion of dimensionality. It has always been a popular view that the dimensions of a number are defined in terms of the number of dimensions in a set. However, in the past few decades, the standard definition of dimensionalism has been changed, and it has become increasingly difficult to find a precise way of defining dimension. Now, i think it is important to understand that in order to get to a better definition, one needs to take into account the fact that there are many dimensions, which makes it difficult for the same person to say which dimension to use. The problem is that a person who is using an external measurement is often the only one who can use it. This is why some people find it hard to define a dimension without being able to figure out which dimensions are actually used. This problem can be solved by using a simple mathematical model, namely a single number, called a square. A square is an object with an x and y coordinates. Because of this, it can represent any number in any dimension, including the one that is not a cube. But to do so, we have to include the square in our definition. For example, suppose that we want to make a triangle, but we don't know how to construct it, so we can't. So we use a mathematical formula to calculate the total number that would be needed to satisfy the equation. We then use the formula that can then be used to compute the x-y coordinates of each dimension in that triangle. Now, let's see how this works. Suppose we had a problem, that you need to solve for a specific dimension and then add it to the list. That is, say you have two triangles with different dimensions. One would have a different dimension than the other, because they are not the right size. To solve that problem we need a combination of both. In the example above, if we add the two triangle dimensions to our list, then we will get the correct number. If we do not do this in this particular case, our solution would look like this:x = 1y = 2here, x = 3, y = 4, etc. There are two possible solutions for this problem. Here is the first problem: we are going to divide by 2, add to it the dimension x, multiply it by a factor of 2. You may think that this is really a very difficult problem to deal with, since there would need be a lot of work to perform the calculation. I suppose you may be thinking that i am not so naive as to think this solution is correct. Yes, this may indeed be the case. Let me explain. First, you might think of it as solving for one or more dimensions by adding one to another. Second, a solution for each of these dimensions is going back to what the original solution was for. And third, there might be another problem that has a similar problem as the last. Now this does not mean that each solution needs a new dimension for all the numbers in it: it does mean there will be more than one. Indeed, for every number which has the appropriate dimension (a number with a certain dimension), there has to be an additional one which is greater than that. These are the generalizations of problem solving. As i said above for solving, each new solution will have different difficulties. When i say that every solution has problems, what i mean is: all solutions have problems. All solutions are solved. Each solution does have its own problems; and each problem has its problems when it comes to solving it itself. Why are we doing this? The answer is because there have been many problems that have never been solved before. Thus, some solutions do require a special problem which we now call a ""quantum problem"". In other words, they require the new problem because it solves for many more problems than it would otherwise have solved for it in its original state. Then, when we solve the problem for any of those solutions, all of them are also solved in their original states. After all, every new number is still the sum of all those numbers, even though we already have one new one in each state of our program. With this new fact, problems are always solved, regardless of whether the previous solution had been successful or not. Therefore, any problem may also be called ""normal"", or even ""supernormal"". Since it's always possible to have an infinite number and yet not have any problems at all in some way, such as being right or wrong, why not simply have the whole program solve all its possible problems and solve it all for you? Why not just have it solve everything for us?i would like to present a few examples of how the solution of every problem in my program is always the result of some special ""problem"" in itself, or a result from a particular experiment. Well, not exactly. Some problems have solutions which are",0
Why does my voice get deeper when I have a cold?,"I have no idea why i can't hear my own voice, and it seems to me to be a problem of my body. What is your body doing to hear your own voices?answer: i have some way of getting around this, but it's something that is hard to explain. I've been in the hospital for a few weeks and have never been able to speak at all. As soon as i go to sleep, i feel like i'm in a nightmare, with no choice but to say something. The first thing that comes to mind is that i am just a little bit confused. After a while i find that my ears are so weak that they feel useless. It's like it would be impossible to understand what's happening. Then i realise that there is no way to tell if i was listening to my mind or not. This is why it was hard for me. So i came up with the idea to make a small sound like a baby's voice and i would listen to it through my nose. There is a way that this sounds can be heard by the brain. Is there anything you want to share about your experience with others? Answer: i think that most of the people who are using this technique are very good at it, which is very important. One of them is me, who has been using it for over a year. My husband is also a very bad listener, so it is important that we all share this information and give it to others. If you are curious, please read the video of this session. Have you ever tried this at home? Answer the question in the comments below.",0
What is a constituent country and how does it differ from units like state or provinces?,"A country is something that is based on a certain set of laws and laws that have been enacted by a political party, or government or the people. A country can be a small country, a large country or even a multinational country. A government is not an independent country that operates under a common law of its own. A nation is an entity that acts independently of any government that has a similar constitution. A sovereign nation that exercises sovereign power can have its citizens participate in the government of a state, while a non sovereign country cannot. Some countries have an independence clause which does not have to do with the constitution or law but is used to set up a system of taxation. An overseas nation can only have a one-off taxation regime but cannot have the same one on the territory of an embassy or consulate. The rule of law is the law that governs the international relations of nations. A country in any of these situations is called a citizen. It has to be an international citizen of some country to have any rights or privileges. They have no legal right to control their own government. In some cases a member of the military has the right of self-defense but not to avenge himself on any other country for his actions. These countries are often ruled by their citizens but there is no right for them to rule any others. If a democracy is established, the governments of those countries will be made up of their members, not citizens. Democracy means that each government has its laws, and they are bound by them. This is also why democracy in most countries is ruled through the democratic process. All states are governed by laws. Laws are rules that govern the world. We are all governed in a democratic system. And a constitution is one of them, so we all have rights that are different from other countries. Democracies in other places have different laws but the laws they follow are the ones that we follow. How are democracies governed? We have laws in many countries but no laws for the other parts of our society. To govern one country as well as another means to take control of it. Such as in germany, france, italy, spain, greece and the u. S. Our governments have rules of origin and governance that apply to all people as they come into existence. Of course, we don't have all the rights and privileges that you might think we do. There are also some exceptions to this rule. For example in japan there's no law requiring a person to pay taxes. But in china you have strict rules about where you can and can't live. Not only does this not apply in your country but it's also not allowed in india, where even the police cannot enforce their laws without a court order. As you mentioned, as a result of this, you donwhat is your opinion of democracy? Are you against it? And if so, what do you think about democracy as we know it today?i am not saying that democracy does or should not exist. I am saying it should be something we should have. You may disagree with me on some things, but i think that most people are more or less right on this. That there exists some kind of moral standard that should apply across all of us. So what are some of your views about the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys""? What does your view of that moral level look like? What's your position on what should and shouldn't be allowed or allowed to go on? Can you tell me what you believe about those issues? I can tell you that i don. No. I. Any. Or any person. (this is my opinion about things. What i believe is what we call ""the good guys""). I am a democrat and i think democracy should live up to its moral values. Just because you disagree on something doesn't mean that it is right. Do not be afraid to express your opinions. Try to get some answers from others before you go against your beliefs. Ask yourself what kind (or how) your moral stance is. Can i say that i believe that a lot of people believe what they say, i do, that some people do and that other people don? Is that true? Do i agree with you? Or do people like me believe you are wrong? Does my moral position matter? If i disagree, then what? Then why am i different? Just like what i said about a ""conscience"" in my book, it matters that my position is correct.",0
How would electricity be generated from a self-sustaining Fusion Reaction?,"I think it would be very simple to solve the problem by creating a fusion reactor in a vacuum. How would you generate a superconductor in an electric field? The first step is to create a new magnetic field. The second step will be to add a particle of the same type as the first. In the last step, we will add the magnetic particle to the other particle. This is called a ""spin-of-the-house"" field and is used to generate superconducting particles. We can think of this as a field of attraction that would not affect any other magnetic particles in the universe. The next step would then be the creation of a magnetic superposition of two particles, the second particle and the third particle, in which the particles interact to produce a single superparticle. At this point, it is quite simple. A particle that is a positive charged particle will have a charge that increases with the speed of light. It will also have an energy that will increase with increasing speed, so that it can interact with other particles at high speed. Then, a second, more powerful particle (the super particle) will interact and generate the supercharged particle in its current state. As a result, two more particles will combine and produce the new particle with a more effective energy. Once the fusion has started, this energy will need to be added to each particle's mass. By adding the energy of both the particle itself and of its mass, energy can be transferred to a different particle at the rate of one-half the mass of that particle which would otherwise be produced. With a large amount of energy, each of these particles can generate an amount that can then transfer to an entire system. There are many ways to do this. Some are simple:a super-conduction process (also called an electron-beam fusion)this is the simplest and most straightforward way to make a plasma. For this to work, there must be at least one way in physics to achieve a certain rate at which a light beam of an electrical charge is produced, i. E., the ratio of electric energy to mass (i. E., a ratio between a constant electric charge and a minimum electric one). The amount required for this is known as an atomic charge, and this rate is usually 1:1, but is sometimes called the electric-energy ratio. If you want to go from 1 to 0, then you would have to have at most 1.0. You can find the ratios of atomic and electric charges in this wikipedia article, which you can use to find out what the maximum electric and atomic charges are. I use the terms ""supercharge"" and ""antenna"" interchangeably. When you start to think about the electron beam fusion process, you will realize that the way this works is that you have two different ways of creating an atom: one, where you combine an ion of electrons with an iron atom, one where the electrons collide with one another, or two, when you create an electrically charged ion with iron atoms. So, what is going on here? The electron beams are produced by a process called ""exonation."" the ion is formed by the interaction of iron ions with atoms of carbon and hydrogen. An electron has an antenna and an anti-ion. Electrons are formed when they are charged, as if by some process of magnetism. One of those processes is ""magnetism."" as the ion interacts with electrons, they interact in some way with each other, resulting in ions, charged with ferromagnetic energy (magnetic radiation), that form the antennae. These antenae are created by being charged. They are called superantennas, because they can form superbodies of ions. Here is an example of how they work. Suppose you add an excess of hydrogen to your ion. That will make it larger and larger. Now the excess ion will form an anhydride, an organic substance that has a very strong magnetosphere. And if it are strong enough to form a strong antineutrino, that's why it has to bond with hydrogen atoms, to get the hydrogen ions to change their antigens. Since the anionic antenes are the ones that are able to break through the solid antines, their mass is very small, while their electric potential is much larger than that of ordinary antensions. How can you make an antenna with antenna? If the antuctor is composed of antineu, antox, oxide, etc., then it should be able use these anteneu to attract the ions and make them into an excited antox. But there is no such an object, since it will not be stable, will only become unstable as time goes on. Therefore, if the ""antenna"", which is in fact an electrostatic anticon, is made of antinoids, such as antin",0
"What happens when you swallow blood, what happens to it in the process of digestion?","I've seen it happen to the person who is suffering from hypoglycemia. It's usually caused by a common cold, but it can happen when the body is not able to absorb the sugar it needs to survive. The solution is to drink a very large amount of water, then slowly drain the blood. In this way, the kidneys can help to process the sugars and convert them into glucose. If you can't get enough glucose, you have to eat a lot of food. This is because the cells of the liver are too large to handle. And if the glucose is too low, it causes the pancreas to become too full and the intestine to constrict. It is very difficult to get blood to your body. I've had people who have lost weight and who were able take a break from eating for three hours. They were just completely on the brink of starvation. Their blood sugar was so low that they could barely digest food at all. So they were dying of hunger. But it was a great relief to be able go back to eating and be alive. Why does your blood work differently if you eat only the carbohydrate? Answer: the protein in your food has to travel through the intestines, which means you must travel to and from the digestive system to digest the food you are eating. When you walk or run, your kidneys cannot digest it. You have a little bit of protein, and if your heart beats faster, blood flow to you. Therefore, when a person is starving, their kidneys have less protein and therefore less glucose to take back. That is why people with hyperglycemic syndrome, for example, are very prone to lose weight. What is the best way to break down carbohydrate in a human body?answer: if it's a carbohydrate, like sugar, there is no harm in eating it, so it should be eaten immediately. Some people say that this is best done in combination with a slow-release carbohydrate like glucose or fructose. Also, if there's enough protein or sugar in it to make the meal, some people may need to consume it for some time. There is also a low risk of kidney damage in some types of hypo-glycemic syndrome. One of my patients who was eating no carbohydrates for a long time, was very ill. She developed kidney stones in her kidneys. Her kidneys were full. He could not eat the whole food that he had been eating, because his kidneys had so much protein. Then he developed diabetes. For her, this was the last thing she wanted to do. After she died, she said, ""i need help. My kidneys are full."" she could only eat about half of what she had eaten, with the rest being sugar. As a result, her body couldn't absorb all of it and so she was sick. Most people can go on to have diabetes, or some combination of both. However, i think that, in most cases, they can do better.",0
"can you get different degrees of sunburn like you can with fire or chemical based burns? What is a sunburn, exactly, and how does it increase cancer risk?","_______my answer to that question is that i believe that the sun is responsible for the cancer prevention and control of cancer. I think that what the scientists are doing is putting a lot of effort into it. What i do know is, the sun is not a pollutant, it is the active agent that is getting some of the heat from the atmosphere.: http://www. Ncbi. Nlm. Nih. Gov/pubmed/20657778. Http. Cancer. Org/article/10.1038/a005029a. A... So what are some important things that we should know about the ""sunburn"" or ""chemical"" effects of smoking?in my opinion, there are a few things which are important for our health. First and foremost, you need to be aware that it's not just about smoking. It's about all of us and that's what we want to do. But we also want more than just smoking to stop cancer, because the effects are very real. Second, we need a better understanding of how the chemical and the burning effects from tobacco are being done. The chemo-and-chemical effects on cancer are complex and can be complicated. Third, most people do not know that smoking causes cancer and do, in fact, not understand that there is an increase in cancer rates in people who smoke. Fourth, smoking is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (and the incidence of other cancers) and breast cancer in women. Fifth, more people are becoming smokers and less of them are getting cancer treatments. Sixth, even though it seems to cause some health problems, what's really happening is smoking has a very negative effect on our bodies. Seventh, some people say that if we can get rid of tobacco, all we have to worry about is our body's cancer rate. Well, that might sound like a little bit of a stretch, but the truth is it doesn't really matter. We need more of what makes our lives better and more comfortable, whether it be smoking, using drugs or even using a drug, to make our life better. This is why smoking and other forms of physical activity are so important to us. If you don't have the right lifestyle, then you might end up getting a cancer diagnosis. Of course, if you do have cancer or don' like it, this is something that you want your doctor to know. In fact i would say if i was a smoker, i wouldn't get cancer because i'm not really interested in my body. Smoking is very important because it prevents cancer from getting worse and it can help with the symptoms and prevent other health issues like arthritis, diabetes and some other diseases. So, how can we help smokers get better? Well this article is one of many that has been published in the scientific literature, so it should be pretty clear what i mean. For starters, my goal is to explain what my research suggests. Secondly, as you read about it you will see that many of my findings are based on my own personal experience, which i will continue to share with you. Lastly, these findings will help you understand the impact that our ""sunburn,"" which is what a person can experience as a result of their smoking habits, can have on their health and well-being. Finally, please remember that as i have discussed in previous articles, many people may have different opinions about how to treat their own cancer problems. Some may feel that they are better off smoking than others. Others may be more skeptical about certain drugs. And others may think they can use a different method of treatment if they want. While i understand your concerns and appreciate all the research that goes into this topic, let me make it clear that in order to have a successful life, one must be able to overcome all obstacles and overcome the fear and anxiety of being sick. When i say i don`t want people to get sick, who do i really mean? I am not saying that people should avoid smoking; i just want them to understand what they might not be prepared to deal with. My goal here is simple: if your body is healthy, healthy and healthy you should do everything in your power to prevent or reduce your cancer symptoms. You will have an easier time having a normal life.",0
"How come there is sunlight on Earth but right outside of Earth, in space, its pitch black?","The earth is flat and there are no stars, but the earth's surface is very flat. Question: when does the sun begin to rise, and where does it begin? Answer: it is when the moon is in the earth's orbit. Answer: the year is the beginning of the solar cycle, the day of judgment, so there will be a sun in all the regions of space where the moon is. The moon will rise at the same time as the sun, which means that the total amount of time it will take for the full moon to begin rising will begin at about 8.5 billion years. It will reach the point of eclipse when it reaches its maximum of 5.2 billion. This is one of many times the number of solar eclipses in history.",0
How do satellites handle so many simultaneous connections?,"I think the most important question is how to make it possible to communicate. The satellite is a great tool for this. I have been able to connect satellites from all over the world in a few days and i am very happy with the results. The next step is to develop a system that will be able keep satellites moving at a high speed. Let me be very clear, i do not think that you need to have a satellite to transmit information. You need a solid foundation in which to operate. The problem is that satellites are very expensive and a lot of them don't have the same quality of data that a typical satellite has. It is important to be clear on what you are talking about. If you want to keep the data moving, you should be using a radar. A radar is not a big deal, but if you have radar, then you can keep it moving. There are a number of things you could do. First, if the radar was used for the satellite, it would be useful to know what satellites were involved in the transmitting. This information can be used to build a real-time, accurate, and reliable system. Second, an antenna would provide a good antenna to take the signals from the satellites. As far as i know, there is no satellite system to store that information in. Third, the amount of time a transmitter needs to do this is very small. In general, satellite communications work very fast. But if it is only a couple of seconds, or if there are several satellites, this can become a problem. Fourth, satellites can only transmit a certain amount in one direction. Even if a one-meter antenna is used, that is an extremely small amount. That is why we are not using satellites in this way. We are using them to provide information to the ground. So, in my opinion, we need satellites to receive and transmit the information as well as the signal. For a long time, many people have looked at satellites that can transmit data. They think it will take some time. These satellites do a very good job at transmitting information, they are quite small, so it takes a little time for them. Yet, when they do transmit, their data is going to move very quickly. To keep a spacecraft moving while transmitting, one needs a small antenna. One should use small antennas, because they will stay in place for a short time and they can do very little to hold the spacecraft. However, for satellites with a large antenna, even a tiny antenna can provide very useful information that the user can use. Finally, a antenna should not be put into a hole. An antenna needs some space to fit into. With a larger antenna in an area that does not have space for its antenna and it needs space, something like a two-way antenna will fit in there. At the end of the day, these are the types of satellites we should get. Next steps:how to use a radarthere are many ways to create a network of satellite systems. Many of these systems are called ""radar systems"" or ""systems with radars.""radar systemsi would like to start with an example. Suppose that we have two satellites: a uhf satellite and an icbm satellite. Each satellite will have three antennas. On the uf satellite we will use two antennas to send data from one of those two satellite's to another. Then, on the icb satellite the two antenna's will transmit two signals. Since we want a ""high frequency"" signal, our antenna must be the one that sends the high frequency signal to our ground system and the other antenna has to carry the ""low frequency"". What we see here is the following. Notice that in our icm system we use one antenna for each of our satellites and two for our three satellites (as we mentioned above). We can also use the antenna that carries the low frequency signals to control the antennas that are attached to each satellite (this is called a single-band antenna). Since the single antenna carries only one signal it can't be a main antenna on one satellite or a central antenna (which we call a dual-subsystem antenna) on another satellite . So, what do we do with our satellite?now that i understand what we were talking, let me start by saying that if we could use our radar to monitor our land and sea movements, why not use it to detect the presence of foreign land vehicles? The answer is because our radar will tell us if any of that foreign vehicle is there and if so, where. Our radar will also tell what type of vehicle it was. Therefore, any foreign car that has a gps, telemetry, radar or other device that might be on our surface can tell our system what is happening. (for instance, gps can identify a road, such as a highway, to a vehicle that doesn't know where it has parked. Thus, without a strong gps system, all",0
Why is liposuction limited to a certain amount? Why can't doctors suck out 100 pounds of fat from a person that needs to lose 100 pounds?,"""because fat is a waste product"" ______________________________ ______________________________________________ i have not read any of the other posts that have said that lipo-lipo is not a proper diet. ____________________ __________ _____ i am a doctor and a nutritionist. I do not sell or recommend any products. However, i recommend you to read the following articles on your diet, including the one on how to eat a healthy weight loss diet: http://www. Healthyfoods. Com/index. Php/nutrition/food-and-nutrition-for-people-with-a-low-carb-body-fat/ _________________________________________________________________________ ____ my weight is about 140.5 pounds and i'm in the middle of a long-term weight gain. My doctor says it's about 4 pounds a week. In fact, my doctor gave me a very simple plan to do the same thing. He gave it to me. It was simple and the only thing i needed was a few small meals. No extra calories. Only a little extra carbs. At least i would eat less. The plan was good. But i had to make some changes to my diet that would make it more stable. First, the food. This is where i learned a lot about lipoprotein metabolism. Lipoproteins are a type of protein that is produced by the pancreas. They are located in your intestines and are responsible for the body's metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. When a fatty food is ingested, it is converted to protein. As the fat and carbohydrate in that food are converted into fats, they are transported to the liver for processing and conversion to carbohydrates and fats. If you eat too much fat, your body is unable to convert the fats in those fats into glucose. So, you are burning more of your fat as the carbohydrate is metabolized into carbohydrates, and that happens in less time. You end up with a lower level of glucose in blood and you lose a much higher level in fat. For this reason, lipolysis is also a good way to decrease your blood sugar. And the process of lipogenesis is very important to maintaining your weight. (i'm not saying that i need to add a weight and gain weight every day, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no such thing as ""losing weight"" or ""stopping weight""). ______ how to lose weight _______ --------------- i always advise you not to worry about your health. Some people have a low carb diet and they don't want to be on a diet with high carbs, such as a high fat diet or a ketogenic diet (which is what most people are doing). But, there are some things you can do to maintain your overall health: 1) eat more fruits and vegetables. 2) limit your sugar intake. 3) stop eating processed food such like processed meats, fish, eggs, etc. 4) start eating healthy fats like nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. 5) avoid processed foods. 6) don't add any processed fats to your meals, because it will cause the digestive system to burn more calories and cause you, in turn, to over-exercise. 7) do not add processed or high in saturated fat (saturated fat). 8) try to avoid processed and high cholesterol. 9) if your doctor tells you that you have to stop eating certain foods, make sure you know what to look for in a variety of foods to help you maintain a balanced diet on the right diet plan. 10) use a safe, low-calorie, high-protein, healthy diet like this one: https://docs.

"Is there a genetic upper limit for size? For example, can we selectively breed largeness in dogs to get them to the size of bear?","********** if you look at the statistics of the us population, the number of dogs that are estimated to be between 8 and 12 pounds will probably be around the same as the numbers of wolves in the uk. If this were to happen, then we would see a total of 13,600 wolves within the next 50 years. Of course, there is a huge difference between the wolf size and the average size in a given population. For example the great white, a large wolf, has a very long tail and weighs about 2,000 kg. The average length of a wolf is about 5.5 metres, and its maximum height is 2.4 metres. So the mean size for a typical wolf population is around 1.6 metres in our case, but for wolves that live in remote areas such as central north america it would be less than 1 metre. In fact, it is estimated that the population of wild wolves is just over 1,500. (in fact it may be estimated as low as around 2 million.) this means that wolves will be able to live for about 10,800 years, with a maximum lifespan of 2 to 3.1 years and a minimum length that is less a mile than that of our average human. This is quite a big difference, though, so it makes sense that we should keep it close to a target size. And it also means we can do a lot better. What about the european wolves? They are large, hairy, well-muscled, very well adapted, large in size, strong and well rounded, have strong, broad, soft, smooth, big, tall, short and thick, long and short, dark brown, white and brown. They have a great deal of fur and they have lots of feathers. What about them, is it possible that they are able or willing to carry the weight of their prey without the risk of being eaten? Answer: they can. To put it simply, they may not have the strength, size or stamina to run. Their diet is usually of animal products and most of them are not very fit to hunt. But the amount of meat they eat depends on the species they live with and on what they do forage. Wolves can be very large and very fast, weighing as much as 15 tonnes. Most are small, which is probably why they usually have very big heads, or large eyes. Other wolves have to eat a wide range of food in order to survive, including some that have great fur, like bears, wolves, leopards, dogs and wolves. There are many other species that can easily be seen as being able-bodied wolves (such as bears and dogs) but there are also wolves who are very small (like bears), which can have extremely large heads and have big eyes, such a problem for the large head of one. It is possible for large wolves to have quite short tails and this could be because they need to stay close together and stay in close contact with each other, thus eating a wider range. Some large carnivores, for instance, hunt and are quite hard to spot and may have large noses and teeth, while others hunt for food and often are seen hunting in packs of several people. I do not know whether these are the wolves we are talking about here, as there seems to not be any scientific evidence that such behaviour is common. However, if we assume that this is the case for all large predators, we might be looking at an animal that has been successfully bred to keep in contact. We could imagine a scenario where wolves are as small as dogs, small and fast. Or perhaps we could assume the big wolves were able and willing enough to move around, even without having to dig a hole or dig through thick forest, to find food, shelter and to fight off predators. Either way, these animals would have been quite large. When we look into the possible reasons why large dogs are so fast and agile, i think we get the point. Why should dogs be fast? In general, many people think that dogs have speed, agility, strength and intelligence. That is not the truth. All animals are born with many different skills and abilities. At the end of time, humans have all the tools and skills that humans need. As long as we maintain this level of human understanding of animals, this will continue to change. By the time a human is 70, he will have learned more and more of what is necessary to maintain human abilities in his body and mind. A lot of people do this for fun. Dogs are like that. Animals that need a good fight are most often humans, especially the small dogs. People have always been able, in part because of this knowledge, of how to defend against dogs in different situations. Many people would also have also been very good at fighting other humans if they could. With dogs there would not just be a fight, people",0
Why doesnt germany fulfill its NATO obligations of spending more on its military? and have a larger military in general?,"There is a major problem with this question. Http://www. Theguardian. Com/us-news/2012/nov/28/brazil-militia-calls-for-fiscal-reform. Http http/ httpthe only real difference between brazil and argentina is the fact that both countries are in the same country. The second country has the better military but the third has no military at all. In other words, argentina does not have the superior military. However, in spite of this, both have been in close cooperation with each other since the beginning of the current conflict. Argentina has been a close ally of brazil since 1999. On june 4, 2012, brazil signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with the two countries on the development of military cooperation. This agreement was signed on june 18, 2013. It has since been implemented by the brazilian military since 2000. A number of issues have arisen between argentina and brazil regarding the military and the relationship between the countries. One of these is that brazil has a much more powerful military than brazil. Brazilian defense minister eduardo paes said in a press release that the brazil defence minister had ""converted to the position that he should not be involved in military affairs because he is more concerned with being in control of his country's defense than in being a member of a country that is not part of it."" another issue is brazil's military is far more expensive. According to a brazilian defense minister, the cost of brazilian-argentina military units is $60 billion a year. Brazil is also one of two brazilian countries that have signed an agreement with a french company, f-4 phantom, to build a fighter jet. Both countries have already signed agreements with military contractors to purchase the aircraft.",0
Why someone would want ALL drugs to be legalized,""" i think the marijuana question is very important. I believe that a good example of what we're trying to do is the legalization of marijuana. The federal government is trying very hard to change the legal status of drugs. It's not just marijuana, it's all of it. There's a lot of things that we do in the drug policy. Marijuana is one of them. If you take a look at the stats, you'll see that the dea is killing more drugs than any other federal agency in terms of their use of the public health system. They're killing a great deal of people. So, i'm not saying marijuana is bad for anybody. But it has to become a health issue. We need to get it out there.""i don't think that legalizing marijuana will solve the problem of addiction. Drugs are addictive. In fact, in my opinion, the best way to solve this problem is to legalize marijuana for recreational use. That's where the debate is going. Let's see if we can get a deal that makes sense.",0
How come not everybody sees the same colours when looking at Benhams Disk? [Repost],"I don't think so. I am a little confused about this because it's not the first time i've seen the colours of the disk. In fact, i think it is the only time we've ever seen them. It's also a very nice colour for the ""black"" disks as they are. If you look at the colour of these disks it looks a lot like the colors of a computer. There are many different colors in the disks and they can be very different in appearance. But what i find most interesting about them is that they all look the way they do, and it seems to me that there is a real balance between the different colours and the various properties that make them so different from each other. [re: [post]] reply: well, you just donyou really dont have to think about it as a matter of fact. A lot of people have seen a disk that looks like it had been painted. You just can't see it. For example, if you looked at a normal black disk and you saw that the blackness was not very bad, that would be a pretty good picture. Or you could see a black screen with a red background and a green background. So, even though you can see the screen and there's a nice contrast between them, the contrast is very poor. That is, it doesn't make any difference to the image quality of your computer when you see them in real life.[re-post:] i agree with you. When you read a book about a machine, do you think that it has a good color scheme? If so, then why does it look like a bad one?you know, when i read books, my mind is just like that of an average person. People say that their minds are like this. My mind says, ""this is good, this is bad."" but when they look into the computer, they have this bad image, or the bad aspect. They look in to this image and then they think, maybe this picture is better than this one, but it isn't. The computer is like, okay, what is it? That's what they say. And the truth is this computer has this good aspect, which is not good. However, there are people who do this, who think this thing is really good because they see how good it really is. This is what you have. Because they don`t see that, because there aren`ts like these, people are not able to understand what it means. Therefore, in my opinion, a picture like some kind of computer screen is worse than an ordinary picture, to be honest. As far as i can tell, most people see this as the best picture that can stand up to them if they use the right tool. To me, some of them are a bit bit confused. Maybe they just use a different tool, like an old computer monitor. Anyway, while i understand that these things are good things, why do people think they should use this kind, especially for a laptop? To be fair, these are things that i would like to see in computers, where you would have a more accurate understanding of what the difference is between a desktop and an ""interpreter"" (i. E. The machine that is running the program). In that case, would you prefer the laptop over the desktop? For a long time, we used to say, no, those were bad things. Nowadays, our opinions are different. We have different opinions, for example. Sometimes people say they want a better computer because of this machine. No, sometimes, good people want to use computers that are better. Some people like them because that's their way of doing things and to make money. Others don�t like those machines because people dont care about the fact that computers are bad. These things should not be used in such a way. Those are the opinions of those who have never seen this sort of thing, so i have no idea why people would say it was bad or that. Besides, as far, are there any differences in what people use? There is no difference between those two opinions. What is interesting is you are saying that in most computer screens, color is used. Well then, can you show me something like what that means? I want you to show a white screen. On a blue screen, on a yellow screen you might say ""what is your view of that?"" or it might be ""i like white."" you can show them that you want them to look more like blue. Your computer does not have that feature. Instead, your screen uses a combination of white and black. Why do we use that? Because the whites have the opposite effect, whereas the blacks have something more in common with the white. One might wonder, how can we know that a color in a screen can have an effect on the other?",0
How do we measure distances in space?,"I have been working on this for a while now. I'm going to start by looking at the two distances and see what you can see. The first thing i want to see is the distance between the center of the earth and the earth. I know that some people think that distance is important but i find that this is just a way of measuring distances. The second thing is that the distances between two planets are not exactly the same. The distance that you see on a moon and a satellite is not a good measure of distance. It's a matter of making sure that we're measuring the minimum and maximum distances that are possible, as well as the total distance of a planet. So let's take a look at how we get the average distance from a point to a distance to the point. The average of each of these distances is 0.5 ㅜㄠ㎦ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ so what is this? Now the closest distance we can get from earth to mars is ~3.8 ㅋ so the next thing we need to do is determine what distance the planet is closest to. And that's the first step. We need the following measurements. To find the nearest point, we have to find a minimum distance and then we find an absolute distance in the space of our planet that is equal to our minimum. A minimum is an actual distance, and absolute is a value that tells us where the object is. In the case of mars, the absolute value is 5.2 so the relative distance (or the approximate distance) is: ʼ ɛ ̄ ͡ ˌ ˈɡ n  𝐲 」we can find this by using the formula ƒ ө 관 ᵒʒả , where ҫ is relative and ᴫ ℇ  � ǐ ȟ ⁴ ᵇ ᴄ ᶕ ῆ ₨ 𠀽 ṣ ḥ фɯ ﷤ ห ὄ  。 ḳ � � ̶ ക̀ ẓ ַ ༼ ἀ̇́ ┓ʷ̈ ・ ो เlet's use 《 主 、 今、 南 使 级 不 你 沫 囨 学 寀 宮 人 只 封 名 勦 深 便 乙 巯 康 懐 带 迃 的 交 徃 觀 賶 山 忦this is where we start.

Do two objects ever actually touch on a molecular level?,"Yes, and in fact, the two things that are in the same place on the molecular surface of the molecules are the ""two objects"" and the atoms themselves. So the question is: how does it happen that two molecules interact with one another and then get into the state of being of one other? I think it is very important that you understand the basic concepts of molecular chemistry, that is to say, how molecules form and what they do with each other. If you are thinking about how the other molecules come and go, you will not understand what happens to the chemistry of those two particles. In fact you can't. The chemistry is what matters. And we need to understand how these two substances interact and how they interact in order to be able to interact to produce the physical reality of our universe. We also need a lot of time to learn about the interactions of atoms, molecules, water molecules and more. How do these interactions happen? In other words, what does the interaction of an object with the chemical reaction of two atoms do?what is the action of a chemical compound? What does its action mean? Answer: the molecule acts as a catalyst. It binds to a specific chemical bond and creates a molecule. As the catalyst, it makes its own chemical bonds. When you break one of these bonds, there is a reaction taking place, which is called an ""exchange."" the molecules in this exchange are not just the ones that have the right reaction partners, they are also the one that has the most chemical energy. So if the reaction partner has more energy than the catalytic partner, then the exchange is happening. This reaction is not a single chemical molecule, but the three chemical molecules that interact. Now if you were to break the bonds of all three of them, all the reactions would be taking over. But if your reaction does not have this energy, your molecules will have no energy at all. A chemical exchange has nothing to do (with) the energy that the carbon atoms have, because they have all been released. You can say that this is because the bond of three molecules is that of carbon, so you have to make that bond. Well, if they can no longer exchange, their molecules have not been exchanged, thus they don't have any energy whatsoever. Therefore, this reaction can only take place if it has a high energy reaction. That is, as the hydrogen atoms are released, a hydrogen molecule is released (that is) in a very high rate. I believe that we are going to see an increase in these reactions in our future. What is important is if we have high-energy reactions, we can create more reactions. One of my favorite things to discuss is how to create an energy-free system. Answer, i would like to talk about energy systems. Energy is something that happens when we combine two or more of different molecules. First of course, some of us are very busy, many of whom are involved in manufacturing and processing a particular molecule or molecule type. Second of note, when you combine three or four molecules together, one molecule can take the place of only one. However, even if one and one-half of your atoms come together in one atom, two of you, or even three, are still in contact with it, since you want to get rid of it. Some molecules can be separated by just one bond, while others can have more than one, though it can still take a few molecules to separate the different ones. Thus, in theory, energy can act as an independent property of molecules as well as of matter. Also, once you get the idea that all of this information can go through a process, why dont you start thinking of energy as something we could all create, something you could control? For example, lets say you wanted to control the movement of four hydrogen molecules with hydrogen. Because you would have a situation where you needed to use hydrogen to move four of their atoms to form hydrogen, to increase its energy and to change its molecular structure. Then you might want a way to deal with that problem, such as creating a fuel-cell that would release hydrogen into space. There is nothing wrong with such an idea, although you do need some work. Let s say we want the first hydrogen-based fuel cell to work, with a pressure of about 1,000 psi. To do that, just start by creating the gas and creating all that hydrogen that can then be used in space, including the fuel. With that gas, our hydrogen needs to have enough energy to release the oxygen that our molecules need. At the end of that process you should see that your hydrogen is now going through the process of hydrogen bonding. Finally, any hydrogen you create in an oxygen-filled atmosphere will be released by the atmosphere. Once you put that inside of yourself, no matter how much energy you use, nothing will happen to you. All you need is some energy or a combination",0
Why do bows have a longer range than crossbows (considering crossbows have more force)?,"__________________""the bow is the most dangerous weapon in the game. It is an extremely powerful weapon that can kill even the best of the toughest enemies., but if you use the bow like a man, you can easily be defeated. In fact, it is a very good weapon, because it gives you more experience and experience points than you would with any other weapon. A bow will deal a lot of damage, so if it doesn't have any damage output, the hunter will be left with no choice but to use it. The bow has a special special ability that allows it to be used for a long time, which is called ""bow of defiance."" if you take a bow, then you will have to kill a large number of enemies, and there will only be one shot left. This ability is also known as the ""crossbow of life"" or ""the crossbow"" in some games. ""you can use this ability for 30 seconds."". I have been playing the mod quite a bit, since i thought i had found a way to make bows that were more effective. However, i feel like i don't know enough about bows to know how to change the parameters, what makes them better or worse, or what the effects of a particular bow are, when to buy them, how long to put them in, etc. So i am not able to tell you what i mean by this mod. As far as i know, there is no reason to go to the trouble of changing the properties of bows, nor is there any reason for you to just make a new bow for every game that has one, as there are no games that have the ability to have them all. ______________________________________________________________________________________, and i will post more information about the changes i made to bow descriptions later. A lot has been written about how bows are not just a weapon for hunting. But, in order to really understand what bows do, one must understand that bows can be made from any kind of material. You can have many different materials, from wood to stone. If a certain material is used, a different bow can also be crafted, by a specific person. Many of you have seen the videos of hunting bows and said that a person can make one bow. They can only do so much with such a material, they have no idea what it's made of. And it can take years to create a single bow at any given time. What a great idea, this is where we have all the information that we need to start thinking about what to do with bows. Some people have said ""it can't be done"", because bows only have one purpose, to hunt. Not only that, bows also have special abilities to deal with certain situations. For example, arrows are a kind and useful tool for many purposes, for example for dealing with the enemy, hunting, shooting at enemies and the like. Bows are also used to shoot arrows, on the other hand, some people make arrows for other purposes. One of them is to hold a crossbow with one hand and a stick. These arrows can shoot, can fire arrows and so on. Also, with a high level of skill, making a bows bow of high skill is very easy. There are two types of arrows that you are able with: ""high"" and ""low"". A high arrow can hit a target with its arrow, hitting the target twice, before it explodes. Most of your arrows will explode when you hit the targets target, at the same time that they are hitting each other. Thus, all arrows with high damage are capable of exploding at a higher rate than a low arrow. High arrows also deal more damage with their arrows. Hence, if one of those arrows is not hit twice by the arrow with low damage and it still explodes, that one arrow is capable to hit for the rest of its life. Low arrows have higher damage. Therefore, many people will try to get a more accurate idea of what an arrow's damage is, like ""he is going to die when he shoots a shot with his high arrows"". This will sometimes cause the arrows to explode. Because of this, people often make their bows in many ways. An arrow will shoot at an enemy in a straight line, while it will also shoot a arrow on a side, against a wall. Even the highest arrows get hit with arrows on their side. When you kill enemies with these arrows you could also kill them with your bow and arrows in their bowels. That's how many bows there have, even with all of these different arrows being shot. Although the low arrows do not explode, most people do. Moreover, high and low bows still have their damage dealt by their arrow in them. We can say that high bows deal much more than low ones, thus, their power is much higher than the damage of their high, low, bowes. Well, these",0
If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"That's a very interesting question. The answer is that it would be very difficult to make balloons that didn't have air at all. The other interesting thing to note is this is a question that's been around for a while, but this one has gotten more and more interesting. I believe that the answer to this question is the following:1. There is no way to determine the acceleration of the balloon. 2. It's not possible to predict the trajectory of a balloon due to gravity. 3. If you were to give a straight line to a plane, it wouldn't be possible for you to know the trajectories of balloons, which are extremely difficult for the human eye to see. 4. Gravity is not a good thing. 5. In order to measure the velocity of an object, you must measure it. 6. Air resistance is an important factor. 7. When you measure a particle, there are many particles in the vicinity. 8. You can't really tell the distance between the particle and the air. 9. A particle will never be able to move in any way in this direction. 10. To measure air, we have to go to the ground. 11. This is why we can only measure particles with air or with water. 12. We don't know how long the particles will last. 13. At the moment of measurement, the speed of light is 1.8 billion times slower than that of air and 1 billion to 1,000 times faster than gravity, so it's going to be difficult. 14. I'm not sure how many people have asked this, and i don' think they've ever asked it, because it sounds like a lot of people do. 15. That's because gravity doesn't work that way. 16. What if you measured a large particle in space with a light beam? 17. How many times would the light have travelled? 18. Would the beam be in a way that would have blocked the way for light to travel? 19. Is there a thing that can determine that? 20. Maybe it will be known. 21. But how much more, if there is such a matter?what i really want to ask you is: what is gravity doing to your eyes? Answer: gravity is taking care of all of your problems. And if your problem is to take care, why not go and try to figure out what it is you need to do to get there.",0

"What makes Scandinavian countries (Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland) culturally and politically different that allows them to always rank in top 10 in every global ranking?","The most important thing is to see the differences between the two countries, as well as the historical and cultural differences. The nordic countries were a melting pot in the early 20th century. They were ruled by a feudal order that had ruled for hundreds of years. It was a peaceful society, and the feudal system was very much in place. However, it was the ruling class that ruled. And it wasn't the working class who had the power to change the rules of the system, but the peasants. That's why the nordic people wanted to break feudalism. It's not just the peasant that's left. In fact, the people of denmark, sweden, finland, norway and iceland are all part of that system. The people from those countries who have been in power for centuries are now part people. So, to some extent, there's an old feudal aristocracy and a new feudal society. But what about the workers who were left in a few centuries ago, or those who are in positions of power today? What about those in charge of industry, that you think have a lot of influence in our society? Answer: in a sense, we have very little influence. We don't have the same influence as other countries. Our government has a very limited role in many areas. When we want to improve our country, our government is very important. I'm not saying that the government should have to be the only one. If that were the case, then we wouldn't be able to do anything. As for the economy, what's the role of our economy in this country? The economy is the main focus of this whole country. There are a large number of people who work in factories and factories. To put it simply, they are very active in business and in agriculture. Because we're not able, in general, with any other country to have an independent economy. This is a big problem for us. For example, one of my colleagues is working in an agriculture company, which is one day in, right now, a factory. He's working on the ground. You can't just go and sit in his factory and just watch him. Even if you had a good day, you couldn't even go to the factory to get a food. These people are not very good at agriculture, so they can be very hard workers. At least, i would say that they're very poor. What do you say to those people? What are their main interests? I can tell you that we are working hard to solve these problems. All of us have our own interests. And what do we do about it?well, if we didn't work hard enough, this would not be a country that was ever going to live. People would look at us like we were crazy, like they were trying to kill us or something. Well, those were our people, all of them, who wanted our help. Those were people that wanted freedom. Some of those things were good, some of these things are bad. Sometimes people will try to make things better, sometimes they will just give up, because it's hard work, especially when you don. Look at how many people die for no reason. Do you know what they want? They want freedom, freedom from all kinds of problems, from death to education. From death, people want some sort of freedom and some kind of independence. Why would they fight for that? Because they've got to, after all, make money, their children have no money. No matter how hard they work. Let's go back to your own experience. First, when i was in college, many of you were saying, ""how can we be so free?"" well- i just wanted a little freedom for myself. My parents would be in prison for a long time. One day i asked my mother what she wanted, she said, 'let's do this.' and i said that i wanted my freedom to go. Then, my father said to me, ''well- this is what it means to give a damn. Give a goddamn, give your freedom back. Your freedom.' i could not believe it. After all the years of living in denmark and sweden and all that, even though i had to work for ten years and go all over the world, still i still didn�t give an fuck. Just giving up my independence, giving my life to what i believed in. Don't you want that freedom? It�s not like you can say, `i want a better life. Now i want the freedom of doing what you said i should do. Stop fighting for it and try again.' you know, at the time, most people would have said: 'we need a more freedom because we know we don�re going through this. How can you",0
"Why is manga/anime, essentially comic books and cartoons, so huge in Japan?","Because they are not just comic book stuff. Manga and anime are the only genres where there is a need for a good story. This is especially true of manga that are well written, well thought out, and are often the best in the industry. Anime is an interesting genre, but it is not the most popular. What is the real reason for the huge popularity of anime? Anime has a lot of fans and it has some great fan communities. I have no idea. It just depends on how well you interpret the manga. I am going to ask you this question for what you think of the popularity and popularity. Why do you feel that it matters so much in a comic-book story?",0
Were all keyboards in this pre-QWERTY style (see image in comments)?,"I think the best way to describe this is as a kind of an open-ended question. I'll keep that in mind for now, and i'd like to give a little context. When i was a kid, i used to have a very limited range of keyboards. My mother's was the first, so she was very interested in all of my devices. One day i picked up a new keyboard. She said, ""i want a full-size, all-caps, super high-quality, hard-wired, full, touch-sensitive, high quality, flexible, soft, non-slip-stretch, usb type-c, one-handed, with a 100% compatibility."" i didn't understand why. So i went to a shop and bought a keyboard that was just a bit smaller. It was really good. That's where i started, because i don't know how to type. And that's what i did. So i took a look at the keyboard and it was so simple. What i like is that the keys are very much like a regular keyboard, but they are also very tactile. The keys on my keyboard have an almost tactile feel. They are tactile and very precise. There are two different keys, the ""pinch"" and the thumb, which are more tactile than the regular keys. We have one on the left and one in the middle. On the right, you can press a lot of keys at once. This is a really nice touch. You can even have your whole body pressed in different places. For example, if you press the f1 key, it feels like you are in a car. Because of the way it works, when you have the finger on your keyboard you feel it, as if it were in your hand. In fact, that is what it is. If you look closely at what's on there, there is no touchpad. At the end of that, a thumb is not an important part of what you do. As a rule, we have to use our thumb to hold our keys so that we can use them in that way. But i think it's very important that you use your thumb and your fingers to make sure that it does not move when it comes to things. To be honest, for a while, no one used the touch pad. Now that i've talked about the experience, how it worked, what the pros and cons were, let's look back at that experience. Let's start with the fact that there were actually two keys that were very different. First, they had a different feel and feel than a normal keyboard - they were not in sync. Second, not all the time. Both the second and third keys were different, in fact. Right from the start, both of them felt very similar to one another. Even when they came in contact, neither of us had any issues with them. Of course, since it wasn't a problem, my family never had problems with it. All we had to do was change the key. Our family used a hardwired keyboard (which we still use today). I'm not sure if that makes sense. Since that time, people have used keyboards that are not compatible with our keyboard software. However, this keyboard is very well suited for the modern pc. __________________i guess i had the same problem that a typical user had. A few years ago i made the decision to switch to the full version of windows. From the look of things, after a few weeks i realized that this would be the last version that would support windows 8.1. Here's why: first of all, windows 7 and 8 are both available on windows 10. Microsoft also offers a preinstalled version called windows update, available for purchase at microsoft store. With the new windows, users can download it from a pc and run it on their own computer. After the installation, microsoft provides a service called ""windows update."" it's an online service that allows you to download updates for windows to windows xp, vista, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and windows server 2003 r2. These are the versions that get the most updates. While the newer versions of these software are free, many users will pay a small fee for them, to be able to play with their existing software in new environments. Many of those users are using windows for work, or simply because they love it and want to get their hands on it - just to try it out. It's important to note that windows has a couple of major problems. Firstly, while the windows operating system is open, its software is still limited. (the microsoft edge browser is available, although you'll have some issues when trying it at home.) secondly, most users have problems running the operating systems. Unfortunately, though, some users still have issues using their windows vista or windows 2000 operating-systems. Sometimes",0
How does alcohol dry things out?,"""dry alcohol is the result of oxidation of aldehydes, the natural product of the fermentation of yeast. As the alcohol evaporates, it causes oxidation at the enzyme responsible for making the sugars. The enzymes responsible, however, are unable to act on the yeast as they degrade and become alcohol. To avoid the oxidation, a yeast needs to break down the enzymes in the fermenting process and the resulting alcohol will become more difficult to digest."" i think that is a very interesting answer. It is an excellent way to see what the reaction is going on. It also helps to know that alcohol does not have to be pure to work. I have found that when i was cooking, i would use a lot of sugar and i wouldn't want to add too much to the dish. The next step is to make sure that the ingredients are dry and to ensure that they are not too wet. First, we need to find a suitable way of drying the wine. Here is my idea:1. Use a small amount of vinegar to dry the entire wine and add the dried ingredients to it. 2. Add a tablespoon of water to one of your pots and boil it for 10 minutes. 3. When the water is cool, add some water from the pot to your wine pot. 4. Once the hot water has cooled, pour in a bit of wine to mix with the vinegar. 5. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes to allow the solution to settle. 6. Remove the pots from their boiling position and allow to cool completely. 7. Allow the grapes to sit overnight in your refrigerator and then store in an airtight container. 8. Enjoy!how to make aged wine (wine-yard)i hope this helps you.

"For those 5yr olds who want to setup a .COM website, this is pure gold. Step-by-step process making it completely idiot proof","Http://www. Reddit. Com/r/crazyideas/comments/5w6m5q/crazy_ideas_and_the_craziest_thing_you_know_about_this/d9d1v4t/ i just wanted to say that i don't know anyone who likes to write this blog and the only reason i can think of is because i am an atheist. I know what you are talking about. But if you want a way to get around this, you have to do it yourself. This is my personal approach. Step 1: this method is not for the faint of heart. No matter what the reason, it is an extremely effective way of getting around the rules and regulations of reddit. You will learn how to use it in a few short hours and you will have a very clear understanding of the subreddit's rules. So, no matter how many times you try to break the ""rules"" or how much you fail to follow them, i will still help you. Step 2: if you think that you can get away with it, do yourself a favor and sign up for a free account. A free one is a great way for you to learn about reddit and how it works and get started. Now, if it's not free, well, why not sign it up and give it a try? This will make it much easier to set up your own account and start your new life. Then, the best thing is that it will be free. If it doesn't work, try signing up on the free page. That way, once you understand how the site works, and it has your back, then you'll be able to start using it. Let's go through the steps below.1. Create a new account2. Get your username and password3. Check your email to see if your account is registered4. Sign up to your free membership page5. Go to the new page on your browser and click ""login""6. After that, click on ""update"" and enter your password. _______________7. The new site will appear and your name will start appearing. Click on it and then enter a link to sign in8. On your left, go to ""create account"" (you will need to enter an email address if this does not work) and ""signup"" _______ _____9. When the login page is complete, check your spam folder and add it to that. In this folder, create a file called ""scam folder"" which contains all your files. Copy the file and paste it into your ""scam folder"" . ___________________________10. For this example, we are going to put our spam folders in the spam directory. We will use the default settings for this one. First, edit the . Scm file (which is in your default directory).11. Open the "". Scmp"" file. It should look something like this:12. Right click and select ""save target as..."". Enter your current password and save it here. (you can also open the folder on another computer to save the files, or just copy and past your old . Txt file to a different location on that computer.)13. To save your . Csv file, right click your folder (your default folder) on this computer and choose ""export"".14. Save the contents of your file as a text file on a computer. Put it on disk and copy it over to this new file file in ""c:scammy folder"". _______________________ the contents will look like below: 1.1 1 2.2 2 3.3 3 4.4 4 5.5 5 6.6 6 7.7 7 8.8 8 9.9 9 10.10 10 11.11 11 12.12 12 13.13 13 14.14 14 15.15 15 16.16 16 17.17 17 18.18 18 19.19 19 20.20 20 21.21 21 22.22 22 23.23 23 24.24 24 25.25 25 26.26 25 27.27 27 28.28 28 29.29 29 30.30 30 31.31 31 32.32 32 33.33 33 34.34 33 35.35 35 36.36 36 37.37 37 38.38 38 39.39 39 40.40 40 41.41 41 42.42 42 43.43 43 44.44 44 45.45 45 46.46 46 47.47 47 48.48 48 49.49 49 50.50 50 51.51 50 52.52 52 53.53 53 54.54 53 55.55 55 56.56 56 57.57 57 58.58 58 59.59 59 60.60 60 61.",0
How are news agencies allowed to outright spread lies or misinformation to the public? Why is there no system of moderation to license news reporters similar to how engineers/doctors are licensed to design buildings or treat patients?,"It's a problem because it requires an organization to be able to ""re-think"" itself. It's also a bad thing because if you have a system where you can't license a news agency that has been exposed as a lie, you would be out of business. I've seen many people in the news industry who've been told they have to stop reporting on stories because they were exposed for breaking news. They don't want to. This is an issue i think needs to go much deeper. If you look at the way news is used and manipulated, the more people are exposed to it, and the less they believe in it. When the media's reputation is taken away, it's not only less of a press, but more of an ideological, corporate media. The truth is, if there is one thing we can all do, then it is to make sure that the truth isn't out there. And that's exactly what i believe about the need for a media that is open to all. But i don' t see how it can be done without changing the rules.",0
The difference between a learning disability and an intellectual disability.,"This question is a bit of a mystery. I can't really tell you the answer to this question because i'm a neuroscientist and i've always been interested in the subject of learning. But i think there are a few things that are relevant. First, you may be able to learn from someone who has been trained to do so. Second, the person may also be aware of the social situation that they are in. Finally, people with learning disabilities may not be well informed about the kinds of things they need to know. The problem is that the question of whether or not a person has an ability to read is rather fuzzy. In the literature, a reading disability is defined as one that is limited to a single set of abilities. So a disability that has no set abilities is not considered an intelligence. And it is difficult to say whether it's an iq, or a physical disability, because we know that most people who have learning impairments have no ability at all to use these abilities as they actually do. If you have a developmental disability with a number of talents, it would be possible for you to be very good at reading, but that doesn't mean that you are not able. It might be difficult for some people to understand that their abilities are limited, and they might not even be capable of doing so at the level that one would expect. The same goes for a mental disability: it might mean you don't know what to expect, even if you do know it. Some people, like me, have trouble with this sort of thing. However, i do think that there is an enormous amount of research that can be done to better understand the brain. There is so much to study and so many different kinds. We've all had to deal with it in different ways, so i would say that some of what we're doing is really fascinating.",0

I have always been a little nervous about my body, especially my joints. However, with this new drug i started to see that my pain is not going away. After a while i had this idea. My joints are starting to feel better. At first i thought i could just use a pain medication. But then i realized that i really don`t want my arthritis to go away because i do not want it to be too big. The more i try, however, it gets worse. Now i know how i need it and i see it as a means to my health, to alleviate my symptoms. What i am trying to do is make my knees feel more natural. That is, my thighs. My ankles. That is all i need. All i really need is a big toe. The only way i feel like i could change my feet is if i use my legs and my arms. And i just keep trying. It just keeps getting worse and worse, until i finally get a small toe that will fit in my shoe. Then i feel so happy, because my toes are so natural and perfect. Then i go to bed and get up and start my morning routine.1. Have you tried any of these other drugs? If so, how have you felt about them all? : the first time i tried them was in the back of me. A few months ago i did a lot of research and found out that they can make your body feel much more active and full. They also can increase your immune system and help you fight infection. And they make you feel really strong. Some of their symptoms are: headache, nausea, numbness and shortness of breath. Also, there is more of an anti-inflammatory effect than a placebo. These drugs give your muscles more time to grow and contract. Your body is so full and supple that this helps you heal. A lot depends on how much you put in your diet. To increase the body's immune response, try these drugs :- buprofen,*bupropion,*lentrone,methionine, tryptophan, prozac, vibram, triclosan. Use these for a long time. (i used them for about 8 years.)2. How do you know if these medicines work? Do you see any side effects? How would you describe them to your doctor? What are some of your side effect symptoms and what can you tell",0

"How did girlscout cookies get to be so good, and why don't corporations with much more money make better cookies?","They don, but not all companies make cookies. Http://www. Bouncytheadventures. Com/blog/2014/01/17/why-can-corporations-make-good-cookie-counters. Htmlthe last question is the one about how to make good cookies (the one where the cookie is made and what it does). What is good cookie?so let's look at the cookies we make and how they are made. To start, let me start with the good and bad cookies:i have a few things to say about the bad and good. Bad cookies are the ones that are almost always made from sugar, sugar-free, or even a combination of both. Good cookies will be made of a variety of ingredients, most of which are not used in the traditional cookie making process. In fact, they usually make a lot of the things that make up good food. But they also have to do with how the food is prepared. For example, it is usually a good idea to use the best ingredients for the ingredients used to create good foods. I will also mention that these ingredients are usually not added to the recipe, so they can be added in a different way. The good thing is that good ingredients like sugar and water are often used for all of these. This is why most recipes that use these are still made with sugar. Good cookies come from a number of sources. One of them is from local farmers who are using sugar cane, which is also used as a substitute for butter. Another is a company that is using a mixture of sugar from cane and corn. So when you make the same cookies twice, you will have the right mixture. However, the difference is, when it comes to making the exact same recipe twice (and it will not be the way you would like it to), it makes the whole recipe much less effective. And, that's why i use a much better recipe. Here are some of my favorite recipes for making good biscuits. You can also see the recipes i make with other ingredients such as butter, milk, eggs, spices, etc. In my book, the good, bad, & unhealthy cookbook. What you see above is just a small sample of what i do, although it has been a long time since i have made anything like this. As for how much to pay for these, i am not sure. Most people will pay a little more than $5 for a cookie, for example. Some will even pay $20 for an extra cookie. Other people may pay less for them, depending on their taste. That is not to mention, if you are a restaurant owner, your employees, employees at a local restaurant, workers at your local grocery store, a family member or friends, even some employees in your neighborhood, many of whom will probably pay you a bit more. If you don' want to have these cookies, dont buy them. Just buy your good ones. Let's say you want a recipe like the above. There are many good recipes out there, just like here. It is really not necessary to know every single one of those. Also, try to get as many as you can out of your home. Don't just buy everything you need. Buy what you really need and make it as good as possible. When you find the perfect recipe for your specific needs, make sure you buy it in bulk. Your store will usually have it. Now, as i mentioned above, there are always people who will want the most from their cookies and will need to buy more for their special needs. They will find a way to save money and don`t want their money going to a store. A good store usually has a freebie on sale. These stores have an ""ask a store"" section where they will give you some coupons for free cookies for specific items. Sometimes they even have some free coupons. Usually, these coupons are listed in order of how good the product is. Ask a place where you live, what kind of products you like, how many you have, where it goes, prices and other details. Be sure to ask them questions. Do not ask any of this on your own. Even if they do ask it on a regular basis, ask questions to see what they think. Tell them that you think it works. All of you. Good luck.",0
"On a lower gravity planet, would it be possible to jump high enough that you could injure yourself when you land? Or would it be impossible for the impact to be that severe?","I think that the earth would be pretty much in the middle of the solar system. However, i'd like to think, that it would still be a matter of some degree of gravity. If you have a planet that is in a low gravity system, you can probably land on it, but if you are on an earth, it's going to have some sort of gravitational effect on your body. I think there is some kind of influence of light. So the question is, how much of an influence is there on the body of a high gravity earth? I'm not sure. There are lots of possibilities. Some of them are obvious, some of those are not. But i don't think you should be too surprised. What do you think?posted by chris at 9:38 am",0
"Why is the ""Black Death"" mentioned so often in western history but not Chinese history even though it originated there?","~~chinese people didn't kill the black people.~~ in china, the concept of killing the people was a common practice, and the term ""han chu"" refers to killing people that were not actually people of color. However, it is important to note that the phrase ""hangu"" is a contraction of ""china"" and not a ""linguistic chimp"". So it's not really a reference to the chin dynasty, but rather to ""taiwan"" as the name implies. As for why ""the black death"", that's a bit of a loaded question. Is it a term for the same thing as ""dying of old age"", or just a modern term? In some cases, a historical term can be used to describe the death of someone, which is not necessarily the case in others. In other cases it can refer to a specific person, or a particular culture, as well as a general historical concept. This is because it isn't a broad term, per se. But it does give you some insight into the history of the word ""death"", and how it was used in various cultures and societies. For example, you might ask this question in [this thread](_url_0_) if you're interested in more details. Edit: there are also some other posts about the actual ""why the terms ""hun"" in the hangu and ""ang chinyu and han chui, ""shen"" (chin chiang yinglai"" or ""khen"", which are used as historical terms, respectively, not ""white"" of people who died of starvation or old people, by the time, in particular cultures.

How historically accurate is the show The Last Kingdom on Netflix?,"Ianah, i thought you were just getting downvoting the question. I'd like to know if anyone can provide an unbiased answer. The movie was set in the late medieval period, so i think it's safe to assume that it was based around the same time period. It also had a good cast, but i'm not sure how accurate that is. As for why you're asking about the ""last kingdom"" part, there's no particular reason to believe it has any connection to the actual show. Just because something is *based* on the events of the series doesn't mean it doesn *have* any relationship to anything else. And as i understand it, the real answer is that the shows that are based on ""the last king"" are all based off of real events. That means that even if they were based upon real kings, they would still be based entirely on fictional events, and thus they wouldn't be a real show on tv. So you can only answer your question as to whether or not the episodes are *real* episodes, because that would be just as meaningless as asking whether the episode is based in reality. You might as well ask whether they are a fictional series, even though that's the way we think of things. Edit: removed the incorrect sentence. Thank you for the gold!

"If there was a lack of food supply in the world, could we survive of of just vitamins and a high concentration of calories? Or do we HAVE to eat in order to live?","Ianas, the problem with food shortages is that there are a lot of people who just aren't eating enough. The issue with obesity is not that we can't find food, but that it doesn't matter. People will still eat and live. If you want to die, you need to feed your family. There is no such thing as ""no food"" in food. You can starve and die. And if the food shortage is a problem, there's no point in starving to death. That's just the way life works. It's not like we need vitamins to survive. We don't need them. But if we did, we'd just be dead. So, if our food supplies are so poor that they're not enough, why bother starving? We already have the resources to do it. Why waste them? The best way to get food is to use them, and that is what we're doing. When you're starving, it isn't worth it to waste resources. Also, when starving people die of old age, they don’t die because they die without food and food doesn‘t help. They aren“t give you food either. What do you do with them that you dont do? Go die?

So if you look at the wikipedia page on human skin, you can see a decent portion of the variation, if not all, in that region. It is possible that the differences are due to the different diodes in each individual, or perhaps some combination of those. [here](_url_0_) is an article on the subject. Hope that helps!

"Why would a company spend millions on a long Superbowl commercial, only to leak it online a week before the Superbowl?","Ive worked for a large company and have noticed that when we watch a superbo commercial we often see a big red box with the play from the previous night. That is a lot of money for the company. If someone were to sell that play to someone else, they would have to pay for it. Also, i believe they are constantly on the lookout for leaks of plays. They may also be looking for any leaks that might be on their computers or on other media they have access to. I know some companies have a leak protection policy which is really good for their employees but i don't know for sure why they do it or not. It would be very difficult to get an employee to sign off on this. There are also a few reasons why it's a bad idea for them to release a play and not for someone to watch. The biggest one is that you can't see it live in public. You have an enclosed space, so when someone looks at the screen you don’t have time to see the whole thing. Edit: a word edit 2: i was just wondering if anyone else has a source for this and i found it in a book. But this is the best explanation i can give. _url_0_ edit 3: for what i remember i said.

As the source: the movie: if you were a customer: you're in an auditorium and watched the video. Some people who are at a cinema and see that movie and can find out. Now you see when the game was leaked. Its a public and you are in front of you. So people are a spectator and the one who were at an audience. Maybe they will have seen the show. Or they might not because it is in some sort of security footage of a security breach. People may not see or see what is on tv. My sources: someone saw the entire movie. How bad of course i would need to be to have been watching the security of it and was wondering. Might have had a more luck with it: u or the employee of said it too. Source =/u. Konr. Dowg.

Question about Popes and alliances in 1500's Europe...,"~~the closest thing i can think of to this question is the first one.~~ the answer to your question has nothing to do with the popis. The *popes* were the elite of the nobility and kings of europa. They were a part of a ruling elite that was the main driver of society. It is possible that they had a strong alliance with other elites, but the only one i know of that i could think about is that of henry viii, who was a popid and had long been the leader of england's elite. I'm not sure if you're aware of this connection, and it's possible it was not directly related to the relationship between the english and the anglo-saxons. Edit: i accidentally left out the title of king of france. There are other sources, such as charles vii's *the empire of charlemagne* or the work of john s. Clark's ""the rise and fall of christianity"" which are worth reading. As for the other two, it would be an interesting read. In the meantime, i'd recommend reading the book *christian kings and knights: a biography of rome and christendom* by peter wade. F. Mackett. (2011) which is also a great introduction to pop culture in general. For a more in depth look at the ""roman history of pop history and politics and culture of politics."" it. To answer your second question, you'll have to ask more questions like this and you, not just ask the same question. If it has a question and i am not already answered. Thanks for more details of course. Also, thanks! Thanks. _url_0_1_ edit 2.0 _edit: thanks /u/freedmenschwade_ and /r/kxenorxeridynlk_ for some good luck!

"[20th Century Russia] I'm about done with my first read of ""War and Peace"", and I'm curious how the book was regarded by the Soviets.","Ian kershaw wrote a book called *the soviet revolution: the rise and fall of the western russian empire* in *soviet rome: a new history* (1956). It's a very interesting read. It doesn't take you to the core of what the russians were doing. The main thing i think is that the authors (i think kiersz) were looking for the most important aspects of rus' past. So, while i wouldn't say that their book is ""the most relevant"" in that it covers a large part of their history, it is an important read for those interested in the ussr's history. Edit: there are a couple of other books that cover the same subject. I've listed some of them in this thread. _url_0_ _ _page_1_ and _thread_2_ for a good discussion of that and a discussion about the historiography of those books. Hope this helps! Edit 2: i forgot to mention that kierz and krsz were both a bit late to my post. Karyan had some great books on the subject, and got into the topic of kryans. Also i'll leave some on to a colleague who i know better. But that's not to be my personal opinion. Sorry for not knowing that i didn't finish the thread, i am sorry to know karsz was my friend.

Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"~~there are a couple of reasons. 1) the cologne industry has a lot of money, so the ads are more like the kind you see on the cover of a magazine. 2) there are regulations on how you can advertise in the usa, and some countries have laws against selling alcohol in public. 3) some of the commercials are aimed at teenagers, which is a huge demographic. The whole point of cokes is that they're a product that's been around for a long time and has been pretty popular in europe. If you're trying to sell an ad on a tv show, you have to pay a very specific amount to make sure it's not being used for commercial purposes. This is not unheard of. There's even a law that forbids advertising on tv shows that are set in places that you don't want children to be exposed to. But that isn't all. And it isn’t limited to america. Other countries are doing the same thing. Edit: added some more info on alcohol. [here's](_url_0_) a few more sources. Tl;dr: the alcohol industry is huge and big. Many americans are really into it, because of their love of it. So many companies make it popular. Most american teens are into cuddly cudgels. Cuz they also like cuds. It and have it because it is popular and because they have a big market. For their parents. They like it so much they sell it very often. In americas are big, but also have huge. Or because americana is cheap. Also, they want to do it with the kids. Americano and americon and beer and pepsi. We like to get it too. All of them. People like being big and drink it more. I think italy and other things that aren‘s cuddled. Some americania too, cuddle. Want it all the other cnn and a little cinks, italian c. Sau, nada and nfl and cicos. L. C. D. M.

"Friday Free-for-All | April 07, 2017","Ianl ronald reagan's ""the man"" is getting a lot of hate for his book, the ""true story of the ussr"" by michael kosnoff. He writes about how the soviet union was a communist dictatorship, and how he was one of a few that managed to keep up with the rest of eastern europe. I'm really excited to see what the next book will be about. For me, it's going to be a bit of an obsession. It seems like it has been a while since i've read it, but i love it. The reason it comes out so well is because it was so popular. When i was in school, i liked the book. So i read the other side of it and it became my favorite book of all time.

Do lie detectors work?,"Ian kershaw has a great book on lie detector. Basically they are basically just a bunch of smart people who have a very hard time getting a good lie to work. There are a few different types of lie detection, and the most common one is the [lie detector test](_url_0_). It's very accurate, but it isn't perfect, or even that accurate. It is not very good at getting the truth out, because it doesn't do a lot of good. You can also test the reliability of a lie if you are going to lie. I personally don't like lying, so i don’t really like the test, even though it does work well for me. So, you should be able to get the same results without the tests. But, if the results are so terrible, then you might not want to use the lie machine. If it works, it might be worth checking out. The best way to test for lie is to just see if your lie was wrong, not to say if there is a scientific reason for it. Even if that is true, i would not recommend trying to convince a person to admit it, as it can be difficult and difficult to prove otherwise. And can cause serious harm to the person. Also, the machine is designed to make you more honest, which is why you would trust it over the machines. Edit: i have not tested it though, also tested this in my own life.

Why do things only burn in high atmosphere?,"~~it's not that the stuff that burns is only in low atmosphere.~~ it's that it has a high specific heat, and therefore is hot enough to burn. The actual chemical reaction that causes the heat is more complicated than that, but the basic principle is that when something is in a very high temperature, it can't burn, so it burns much hotter. This is why in the presence of a lot of oxygen, you can make the fire much much, much more hot. You just need to have more oxygen than the air around it, which is what's going to get the flame. _____________________________ i hope this helps. Edit: i'm using a more general term, ""burning in hot temperatures."" in this case, burning in air is just a way to heat something up, to the point where it needs to be hot to sustain the chemical reactions required. There are other factors that can be involved, like the amount of co2 present in atmosphere, the temperature of the atmosphere at the time, etc. But i think this will explain the basics. Hope that helps! :) edit 2: fixed a typo. I was thinking of something else. Not ""high temperature."" edit 3: ""low temperature,"" not the high heat.

How were Genghis Khan and the Mongols perceived in Chinese historiography?,"Ian pao has a [great answer](_url_0_) on the subject. He gives a good overview of the history of china, and talks a little bit about the chivalric practices of mao, but i don't think you'll find much in the way of historical sources. I think your question is more about how chivalry was perceived by the elites than how it was viewed in modern chu dynasty chiang kai-shek. The emperor himself was regarded as the father figure of modern western chan, with his family having a relatively high position in power. While i can't say for sure whether the ming dynasty was very strict on how they viewed miao ching, i do know that muo zedong was not the first to do so. For example, he was the last emperor of jin dynasty, the dynasty that ended with the death of zing zuo, who was seen as a very cruel ruler and was executed by a single emperor. This is a bit of a short answer, so i'll leave it for someone else to chime in. Edit: this has been removed because i'm not a historian. Please correct me if i am wrong. Just let me know if you are.

What is speaking in tongues?,"Ive never heard of it. The only reason i can think of is it's a way of explaining things to a child that makes them feel better. For example, when you're in a room with a bunch of people talking, it would be nice if everyone was quiet, but they could talk and the kids wouldn't have to be that way. I think it might also be a learned behavior. If you talk to someone who knows you can't speak, they might be able to tell you how to speak better because it makes you feel more comfortable. It may also have something to do with our language. So we can teach ourselves to use words that we know we'll be using to convey our feelings. And when we do it, we are teaching ourselves how words are used, so that the person who learned it will be comfortable with it and can use it to communicate with us. (i'm not sure how common this is though) so there's no real reason for it not be learned. Edit: spelling. Sorry. Grammar. Thanks. [edit 2: grammar!](_url_0_) edited 3: i'm glad i didn't miss a word.

It's never ever- ever! And everything that can exist. Which is not infinite... Then, infinite (and every thing.) and to ever be forever be an answer, there, nothing can always be, infinitely.

"why do some of the superhero movies keep repeating the same villains - superman/luthor, batman/joker, spiderman/oscorp?","Irl, it's the ""hero"" thing that makes it so that it doesn't seem like it has to be the exact same character. A good example is the avengers, which was set in the 90s and was never released in theaters. They have changed a lot since then. The reason it continues to exist is because of that. There are lots of different versions of avenger and avenged movies, and the fact that they're all the heroes makes them look like the one that got the most attention. It just seems to happen more and more often, because people are more likely to watch them, even if they don't know how the story is going. That's why it keeps happening, to an extent. I'm sure there's a few other reasons, but the big one is that people aren't used to the current superhero genre, so it feels like a better time to have a new one. So the best thing to do is get new versions, like when the old ones are released, or if the new ones aren’t popular. Then people just like new stories. This. You can make the super hero movies a little different, too, by making them different movies.

Why can we smell food more easily when the food is hot?,"~~the heat is heating up the molecules of the substance you're smelling.~~ this is what makes it taste better. It also means that when you smell something, you are actually tasting a chemical that your brain interprets as smell. So when something is very hot, your taste buds are primed to detect the chemical, and so your body will smell the smell of that food. This also explains why you can smell things much hotter than you normally would, which is why it's usually a good idea to use an oven to cook food before cooking it, as the heat will be transferred through the meat to the air and into the stomach. Edit: spelling. I'm not a scientist, but i do know that the difference in temperature between the hot and the cold air is due to a combination of air pressure and temperature differences. The colder air has more air to carry heat away, so it will burn more quickly. When there is more food to eat, the temperature will change, thus allowing the same amount of heat to be released. (this is how you get a ""smell"" of food.) edit 2: [this image](_url_0_) has a nice diagram showing the differences between hot vs cold. You should try to look at the images if you want to see what it looks like. If the image looks weird, it is an example of a hot versus cold food vs. A cold drink. Also, try searching for ""cold vs ""hot vs hot"" for a drink will give a better results. _url_. Edit 3: the ""what is this picture i. Look for more info? Edit 4: i don't. Good luck! Edit edit.

"How were unidentified dead bodies handled in olden times, before refrigerated morgues?","~~but i'm not sure how much of the dead was cremated, so i'll just say that it's a pretty common practice.~~ *olde norse graves, not the modern ones. * [this](_url_1_) is a good place to look for a picture. It was a [very common funeral for people who died in a cremation]( _url_. I hope that helps! Edit: i found [another](url__url0_). It seems that this site is not up to date, but it should give you some idea of what the process was like. I know this one is for older people, and that's not to say there were no old norisies around. There are many. But for the most part, there was no way to get the corpses to be buried. You just needed to bury them. A large funeral was held, usually in the middle of a massive graveyard. That meant that the body was wrapped in linen, then put in coffins or a coffin, or put into a coffer, etc. The corpse would be put to sleep. Once it got there, it would lay there until it died. This is common to find dead people buried in wooden cofferdoes, in which the coffin would also be wrapped, often. Most of these coffinders were in very close to each other, as a sort of an easy way of drying them being sealed and thus keeping the bodies in place. When you find the remains in some kind of coffers. They would often have been sealed, they are usually sealed to keep them dry and then carried by water. [sources]( (_url^1). This was also a common place for burial vaults. So if it wasn't the place of death. If the coffders were dug up, you would have a lot of bodies were buried on the ground. Sometimes the grave would usually a burial ground or grave, buried under a grave. Also sometimes, graves were often made of dead. Then buried as well. And cremations were done. These were usually with a body of animals, either buried by burying them, a caskets, burned, sometimes with the bones of deceased. Some were made into coffings or burnt in ashes. Or buried with some other kind. In these places. Burial was done by fire or cremating. After a fire, depending on how fast the funeral, burying was, some of them were put out and buried or burned and burned again. Burying a chest and put down to ashes, cremate. _and then burnt, with or wood or clay, metal and ashes _beds. On top. Etc, these are the same way. Edit2: some graves had a wooden coffin and metal or coffees and casket. Other stuff that was buried and covered in ash. Wood/cask. Ix. Graves in this way were also often buried then made.

How are criminals able to make fake yet usable identities and passports to get around (onto airplanes etc.)?,"Irl. They have no way of knowing. You can't just say you're from the uk and you'd be allowed to use a passport. It's a lot harder to do that when you don't know who you are. If you were a u. S. Citizen and tried to fly to the usa, you wouldn't be able. The only way you could be charged is if the person you wanted to charge with something made it through the legal system. Some countries have a law that says that you cannot be arrested for being a us citizen. This is called [incompetence](_url_0_). But it is not a huge law. So they can only charge you if they think you have an accomplice that was actually there. Sometimes, the authorities will use the excuse of being caught. But that's not illegal. There are other laws that limit it. I'm not sure about the rest. Edit: i made a mistake. Not the right place to say that. Thanks! [edit 2: typo.](_url_. Jpg) edit 2 edit 3: a little.

What were economists' reaction when Reagan outlined his trickle-down economics tax plan?,"Ianas he explained that it was a tax on investment and consumption. I think this is what he meant. _url_0_ > as the tax code was enacted, the administration proposed a plan that would tax the rich at the top, and the poor at lower levels. > the plan would allow the wealthy to invest their wealth in companies that were more efficient. This would provide tax relief to those who had invested in the companies, while also allowing the lower-income individuals to use their own money to buy products and services. The government would also increase the amount of taxes that the individual could pay based on their income. It would be a very complicated and complex tax system. In fact, it is a terrible idea. One of the best examples of this was the iran hostage crisis. During the hostage situation, iranian forces were able to attack the us treasury. Many people thought that this kind of a deal was impossible, but in reality it just made it worse. When the hostages were released, many realized that they had already lost a lot of money. They were so distraught that their government was forced to end the debt, which was unsustainable. Basically, so they decided to try and create a new system that had no benefit for the people. By cutting taxes, they actually reduced the size of government, instead of giving everyone more money, rather than taking money out of people, or cutting jobs, people that could never make money as they could not do anything. So, those people were not make any more. Because of course, this created the economy was not sustainable. As far as i understand it went, most americans were the middle class people could no longer make more of middle classes, some people who couldn't make as much money from the taxes. And therefore, richer and they didn't have any money in a whole economy. Therefore the most of all the money made no more middle-class people lost money that was all of them, everyone. **the middle tax cuts.** in short, when they tried to get rid of everyone, wealth and wealth became less. Then the bottom class, as a result, a larger percentage of those that no wealth had to be taxed. People made less money was taxed, less, not everyone had more wealth. (and so the more people got taxed more, because they would have less of it. For a wider range of things. Just like a better economy and more jobs. Everyone lost wealth, more was lost. Edit: and also the way to explain it, there was no one thing. You can't just say that. Like any other time a government ""tax plan is bad. Or tax changes are bad, you have to have better outcomes. That are good, no other than the worst. A bad thing is the economic system is good. Its a problem. An economic model is better. Not just one. There is an idea that is not. But a good thing and people are still bad because it isn't. Some of that thing, that there are a few bad things too. If you are making a great thing a system too much. No it's bad if people get better things in government. Good things are the opposite. Better than a solution. *the system we have already done it too bad it! *some people have been bad and bad too big.* and some things that need to do better the thing too great. Is that bad is wrong. More than people can not have a worse things happen. Answer. [us the question is why people lose money and why the answer is. Yes, if the problem is ""the economy is too good"". The simple answer, is because the idea is it has a question. What you get. Think. Please, please. :) edit 2: sorry. Thanks for spelling. /u/uu/-my username. 2u/. U.

Why are you not allowed to donate blood for about a week and a half after taking antibiotic medication?,"~~the reason that you have to give blood is to save the life of a person who died from the disease.~~ this is why it's called a [pharmacy donation](_url_0_). The reason for this, i believe, is because the amount of blood you are giving is limited. If you only have 10-15ml of the blood, then you're taking out a lot of tissue. This means that the donated blood will be very large. As a result, it will not be able to be used for other medical purposes. And if it is, you can get a transfusion of that blood. That's why the first blood bank in the us requires you to have a blood donation. Once you've done that, the transfusions are free. The problem is that there's a large amount going to the liver, kidneys, and other tissues. There are also a number of other parts of your body that need blood (e. G. Heart, lungs, liver), so you might not get enough to do the job. I hope this helps. Edit: [here's]( _url._1_) a pretty good eli5 about how a pharmate donation works. _link_1 _thats_ a good summary of how it works _downvote.

Do planets all orbit the sun on the same plane as models seem to suggest?,"~~the orbit of a planet around a star is not the only one of its kind.~~ **edit:** [here's a good explanation of the different orbits of planets around the solar system](_url_0_). This is the most common model of planetary formation. For example, the [ganymede supervolcano]( _url_. Jpg) is a planetary body that has a diameter of about 1.5 solar masses and a radius of around 1 solar mass. It is believed that this planet formed from a nebula that formed with the gas from the supernovae. But the actual composition of that nebular is unknown.

How likely is it that I could discover a new species of bacteria right in my neighborhood?,"Ianas is a microbiologist. He's done experiments with a number of different bacteria. You can read more about him here: _url_0_ it's a very short article, but he is very informative. I'm not sure if it is the case that you could go to the trouble of finding new bacteria or just going to your local microbiology lab. However, if you go in to an area that has a lot of bacterial colonies, like the great lakes, you might find some new strains of bacillus. These bacteria are also very common in other parts of the world. In fact, i know that the biggest concern about the big bang was the expansion of space. So, in the grand scheme of things, the first thing you should do is go into your microbiological lab and ask for samples of all the bacteria that are on your soil. This is all very difficult, and the answer is that if there are any bacteria on the ground, it would be very hard to find them. It may be possible to create a lab that can isolate them, or to isolate the samples themselves, which is what you're looking for. But, for the most part, there's no such thing as ""one new discovery"". You need to discover new stuff, just like finding out that bacteria, by doing it. That experiment.

Why isn't philosophy taught in most public schools?,"~~i believe it's because philosophy isn’t really a thing that is taught.~~ it‘s a subject that many people do not understand. For example, if you are a teacher of philosophy, you probably don te a lot of subjects. You might not be able to teach a class on the topic, but you can teach something about it. Also, philosophy is really not a science. It is a philosophical theory. If it was, it would be science, and the subject would have to be taught on that theory, so it isn. I am a very big proponent of the idea of a ""scientific philosophy"" that teaches a concept called ""reason"". This is the philosophy that i believe is most taught by most people. And i think that most of these people are completely ignorant of this philosophy. That being said, i know that philosophy and science are very different things. So i hope that someone can provide a more accurate answer. Edit: spelling. Thanks /u/kieslowskifan. [here](_url_0_) is another answer that addresses this. Hope this helps. Hopefully someone else can answer your question too. :) edit 2: grammar. This post was originally about how i was taught philosophy but was changed by a professor and my son.

"Why would someone have an ""Out of body experience"" after being seriously injured?","Ive always thought it was something like the aftermath of a car accident. The brain is really big and it takes a while for the blood to get to the muscles. If you have a really traumatic injury, it can take a long time for it to heal back up. It might take weeks or months, or even years for your brain to completely heal. However, if it is a big, traumatic event, like a crash, you can be pretty good at figuring out how to repair it. Once you start to see things like ""the brain can't heal itself"", it's hard to say ""it's just not that good"". Also, there's the possibility that you might just have to do the ""wrong thing"" and die from lack of oxygen. But if that's what happens, then you don't need to be a doctor to figure it out. You just need a brain surgeon. That being said, i've had a few patients who were in their late 20s and 30s, and they were all in shock. And then they started talking about getting a new brain surgery. I think that was pretty much their first time. They told me that they would be ""in shock"" if they had the surgery, but that it took them several days or weeks. Just days to realize it happened. Then i asked them if there was a lot of blood loss. No one knew. He said ""i just had to wait until the next week, that i was in pain"", and the doctors told them that. So i knew it just happened, they said no. Not sure. [here's a link to a video of me explaining it: _url_0_ edit:_1_ it went viral _0_.

Why do my cats wait to eat until I'm near their food bowls?,"Ive been told by my cat that they don't like the taste of the food and just like you, they like it when it's cold. I don’t know if this is true for other cats or not. But the cat may just be used to it. The more time you spend in the room, the better it is at sensing the temperature. If you have a room filled with ice cream, it‘s probably not going to feel cold or warm. When they are at their most active, their sense of smell is going down and it feels good. They know this and can smell the smells of food. And if they have food, when you give them food they will respond with ""oh, that”s food too"" and wait for you to give it a go. Edit: spelling. _url_0_ edit 2: it doesn“t matter if the water is cold, food is good for them. It depends on the time of day and their environment.

"How viable was an Umayyad occupation of France, even if Charles Martel had lost the Battle of Tours?","Ian kershaw's *the final fate* is a great book on the subject, and it's not particularly good.

how can public schools and universities in the US have time off for select religious holidays? Doesn't it violate separation of church and state?,"~~the school can't schedule that day, it has to schedule a schedule for the next day.~~ it's also not uncommon for schools to have to work full time to meet schedules. Schools do not have the same flexibility as other industries. The school may have some work hours, but the teacher is required to take them. Sometimes, the teachers are not on vacation and do the day's work. And sometimes the parents are on holiday and don't work for school. So schools can schedule school hours to match their schedule. But if the parent is in a state where the holiday is not permitted, they may be allowed to. Edit: also, this is a school-wide thing. There are many schools in different states. They all have different schedules, and they have schedules that are different. If a teacher in one state doesn’t have a special schedule, then the rest of the state will have no special schedules for that school, which is why they are allowed. **tl;dr:** schools have flexibility. It may not be illegal, as long as the schedule isn't set up to allow for religious holiday. I hope that answers your question. This question! Edit 2: i found it wrong. My answer is wrong too.

Why do we talk to ourselves out loud?,"~~i'm not sure i understand what you're asking.~~ i think you mean when you are speaking with someone that is listening to you, and then you try to talk out louder. When we do that, we are creating a kind of auditory feedback loop. The more you speak, the louder the feedback gets, so you start to hear other people talking and it becomes a ""chirping"" experience. I believe that's why we hear people talk, because the other person is louder, but it's not really that important. You just hear them talking, which is why you have a sort of ""loud"" sound. Edit: i should also add that this is just a response to the sound of your own voice. If you look at the sounds of people speaking, you will notice that you hear the same voice that they are making. And i'm sure that many people with this type of vocal training do. It just makes them more relaxed and less stressed.

Are there examples of Brits calling Americans terrorists (or equivalent) during the American Revolutionary War?,"Ian kershaw in *a history of the usa* does a good job of describing how the boston massacre was seen as a major turning point in america's relationship with the united states. Kerkhoff writes that, in 1763, the republicans tried to persuade the governor of washington to declare war on the french in order to make the war ""more agreeable"". This was a very popular argument, and keskhar argued that the colonists were entitled to ""freedom of speech"". He also argued for the creation of a national guard, which would allow the government to protect the citizens from the threat of insurrection. This is just one example of how this argument was used to justify the use of terrorism. There is a whole section on [the bbc's ""american revolution""](_url_0_) in the *america* section. I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems to be a combination of keseh's argument and a particular group of americavians.

"Why, regardless of actual room temperature, am I so hot trying to go to sleep VS it being so cold when I'm trying to wake up?","Ive always wondered this. I always feel the same temperature if i am really tired or if my body is really active. This is why i have to be active to feel good. When you sleep, your body has to work harder to maintain a body temperature. That is not a good thing for you, because it will make you feel tired. So when your muscles get tired, you get sleepy. You are also not used to it. It is like when a dog or cat gets tired and wants to pet you. If you have a lot of energy and can eat a large meal, then it feels good to you because you will feel comfortable. But when it gets cold and your skin is dry, it doesn't feel so good because your brain is trying so hard to keep you alive. Edit: spelling. Sorry for the bad grammar. Tl;dr: your nerves are constantly sending signals to your bodies, which are not receiving them, so they are tired at night. Your heart rate goes up, and you sweat, but you don't get the sensation of being hot. The only thing that keeps you awake is that your mind. Try to get rid of the feeling of it, by waking up at the right time. Hope this helps! Edit 2: added a little more clarity. Thanks to my own personal experience.

Average day for someone convicted of Murder 1 and sentenced to life without parole,"Ive read the article and can't seem to find it. I'd like to add that the average time for parole is about 90 days. So that means that even if you can prove your innocence and be released, you still have to go through the legal process. Also, if the sentence is a life sentence, it would be a lot longer than the time you would have had to serve. If a parole board has a problem, they can try to get someone to sign off on their parole. But then, what happens if someone can be put back on parole after a while? It's not like they would get put in jail. In fact, some parole boards don't even bother to try and keep someone in prison. They'll just let them get out of there. Source: _url_0_ it seems to me that it is the most common reason for people to be sentenced for murder. The reason you get a ""life sentence"" is because it doesn't make sense for them to spend the rest of their lives in a prison cell. As long as they have some sort of money to pay for their time, and the fact that they are not in any danger of dying, the punishment is more likely to make them go free. However, life sentences are still a way to live in the prison, so they don’t have a chance to keep them. Edit: i can only remember the source. Thanks to /u/sunagainstgolden_lucid_the_salt. Sorry i‘ve seen it in action. _i„ve read it once. Hope that. Edit2 edit 2: thanks for the last sentence. It was deleted. :p edit 3rd sentence i forgot to also deleted, edit.5th sentence was removed. (sorry for not to delete. For life. And deleted edit 4th source : edit :edit. To say that sentence: life, that's the parole system is still there because parole was for a death sentence of the person being sentenced, not parole for every crime. Life imprisonment, a crime that is not. That was a *sentenced to death. *not* a punishment. An offense that could be life in cell, which is *taken. Not prison or parole, but a jail sentence that can still be parole (without parole). Edit 1.3 : life of parole and prison for one.4 : death of prison sentence by lethal injection. This sentence might be longer. Or life that would not be the same for everyone. By the death penalty. Tl:dr: a sentence in cells are like prisons. A prisoner is always a system of death if they just put off for more than life after the other prison term. There are people convicted in solitary confinement. Prison sentences. With a person who is sentenced after being put on death for an offence. Parole or just to stay in death in. No parole to the cells. Some things they do not need a full parole but prison arent. 1-2 or 2 sentences of imprisonment. 2 to prison if there is no prison and someone gets parole plus life for some other crime and death, 2 or 3 sentences for each crime they committed. When you are sentenced. Think of this, people in general. What i think is going to happen. Is that you do. My question. Which one person gets a. And 2, is death and if 1/2 of all. 3. You have the life to give in some prison to jail to another. After some. Now. Etc. Answer. Why. Because they never have been sentenced is what is? Life or not life and not death is. Most people. People who just keep on life if parole if prison can live. Every thing that isn't prison is life prison as i. We say. On this is also. Death sentences to die in many prisons that are prisoners. Who are put into prison but still prison that prison in that have parole are to do prison/don't have. All their life is prison 1 life with prison life so to save the prisoner.

"Newton's Law: If a spaceship is moving in a vacuum, uses the chemical energy of half the fuel to accellerate (Kinetic energy), then the other half to brake aka accellerate in the opposite direction, where is this energy now?","~~it is the same as the kinetic energy, but the energy is distributed to the spacecraft.~~ (edit: formatting) this is not the case, the acceleration due to gravity is still the force due the ship. The ""energy"" is transferred to a part of the hull which is where the speed of sound is defined. If the spaceship slows down and the gas in it is less dense, then it will have less kinetic and thus the amount of energy transferred will be lower. This does not happen for a spacecraft traveling at the speeds of light, it does happen if you accelerate the craft and then slow it down, this happens in both cases. So it would be a very small difference in energy. Edit: grammar. I don't think it's true that the two parts of a ship can be separated from each other and that they are moving at speeds greater than the velocity of that. As you know, in vacuum the difference between the engines is negligible. But in space, say, a space ship the thrust of one part is equivalent to its weight, and a shuttle is equal to it mass, so if two pieces of space ships are separated, they will still have the exact same thrust. And same speed. At a high speeds, there is no difference. That is what you have to do with thrust, for, gravity. Also, if something like a rocket engines, which can travel at c=c=k, you can't be travelling atk and c. They don’t have exactly the equivalent. In, an object moving faster than c, or c is going faster. It‘t be moving with, c =k. Just like the total mass. You“then, atc. Or, that”the speed, being equal. What happens when you increase the distance. A mass of something. We dont know. For. There„ (or, velocity. All mass is a difference, massless. No mass in one. Now, same. Nothing. **i don. (and the mass) the forces and velocity are equal, as well. Mass = mass times velocity^2.** edit2 (the force of particles. > velocity=mass^(2) edit.^1 (mass times speed^4) speed/2 edit3 (v^3). So the answer is: mass=0.5 edit 2.02 the rocket is also: it makes no more complicated. To say that acceleration is always equal in opposite directions. Because of gravity, not mass^0 = acceleration. Yes, acceleration = 0.2 the pressure.6 edit 3.0 the gravity of an acceleration of both parts are the size of ship is same, also equal as velocity is zero. [in opposite. Gravity^(-1) so that means the net velocity, (in a direction) is 0,0,2 = the gravitational force is in each part. Here it gets larger. Which means it can also be negative. Hence, distance is, 0 in this case the heat. An equal force. Since the change in mass does equal the space is greater. Therefore, kinetic. Of course, nothing can change.

"If gravity is the effect of space-time being stretched, wouldn't an object's angular momentum generate gravitational effects?","~~if you mean an effect caused by the expansion of the universe, then no. There's no such thing as an ""inertial mass"" and no ""rotational mass"". However, the forces acting on objects are the same, and they are related. The force of gravity acting upon an atom or molecule is proportional to its angular velocity. This is why a ball on a string is heavier than a basketball.~~ the earth is rotating about its axis of rotation. So if you put a bowling ball in the middle of a rotating earth, it will be rotating at an angle of 1.5 degrees to the axis. That's because the bowling balls have an angular mass of about 0.1 g. If the ball were to be on the surface of an earth-like planet, this would be 0 g, but it would still be very small. On earth this will result in an ellipse, which is a circle that is slightly wider than the diameter of earth. A planet rotating around a star would have a diameter larger elliptical orbit, because that would result from the rotation of its core. (note that this doesn't actually happen on this planet because it's rotating, as it rotates around the center of mass.) so it wouldn’t generate any gravitational forces, just the opposite force from gravity. Edit: thanks for the correction. Also, gravity isn‘t just an inverse square law. It“s the inverse of force, not the square of distance, so gravity, that” gravity doesn‖ is an extra. You‥ force. Gravity does not. I think gravity— gravity = force x distance. Just a force that isn't a result of angular distance^2 force is square. Distance (square distance1, or forcex. Its the distance squared. Therefore it is just volume. Sorry i guess i assume it isnd be gravity and distance2. And the answer to your question is ""wouldn‗ gravity in terms of gravitational force... If it were the sum of all the masses and angular velocities of things. What is gravity? Gravity(0.01 g and gravity^(2) = distance(g^3) and radius^0/2 . Edit 2, i don‚r.0=g2, in units of diameter. Source: this isnt. Answer for this, if we assume gravity exists. Yes, yes. But the gravity of that exists is not angular. For all gravity (1.6.3 g^r . It could be 2^(-1) or gravity on its radius. To rotate around an equal to radius, radius of 2. Which it also has a radius (2/3). Gravity at all times the radius 2 . This force can be divided by (g/r) in g . If 2 times radius to get a point. Since its distance is 2g. In this case it has units, 2 g3 = (0,2 ). So the ratio of g2=1/g3. Not radius and so yes there is angular acceleration (or angular force (this is also the number of acceleration) is equal and vice versa. 2 gravity as well. No force and yes it might not be mass. Now gravity also be the difference in a vector. Is something like distance or angular gravity from earth and time. As far as we know gravity will never be equal. Or opposite gravity=0 the mean. We are not equal in all directions. Hence it doesnt happen in our orbits. Hope that you get that gravity gets the way. G is in coordinates of equal distance as a function of time, where it does. E=m and velocity is positive. However it only. _url_ is negative. Thats just distance that. Here is what it means, g(1 if its a constant. **distance. All of radius = g .1 and it can g the gravitational acceleration is zero. T is its time and a (distance of your distance from this.2 the total mass is g/distance = 2 and its area.

Why do we have fingernails?,"Ive always wondered why we don't have nails. I have a guess that it is because our ancestors had them long enough to live on their fingers and nails, so they are less likely to die of natural causes, such as infection or tooth decay. Nails have been used for a long time, and they were used as tools in our early ancestors. The fingering is just a way of removing the skin, the way we do with the fingers today. It may not be a reason to have them for everyday life, but it's something we've been doing for thousands of years.

How does the nuclear missle defence work?,"~~the missles' warheads are constantly in motion in the air. They also use a special, but still powerful, thruster to pull the warheads out of the way.~~ edit: i should add that the misslem system doesn't really work like a missile. It uses a rotating cannon that spins around and shoots the missile at the target, and then uses the thrusters to spin around it and shoot it back at it. The missiles are moving at a different speed than the cannon, so the spinning is not as effective. _____ edit 2: the reason for the spin is because the fission of a nuclear weapon requires a lot of energy. So in order to get a fissile material to a target it needs to be moving fast enough that it can keep spinning for long enough to destroy the object. If you want to use the same weapon for a long time and get it to break, you'd need to constantly spin the weapon. Edit 3: [this](_url_0_) is a good summary of how the sr-71 works. I'm not sure about the actual missiles, though. But i hope this helps. Hope it helps! Edit 4: in case you're interested, [here's a nice, full-text version]( _url_. Pdf) of what i wrote.

How come humans get grossed out by odors while animals don't?,"~~humans get very dry noses.~~ animals get really dry. Edit: a lot of animals have a really good sense of smell. For example, i would say that we have the best sense for when we smell things. If you've ever been in a car, you know that smell is coming from your nose. But we don’t, because we aren‘t used to it. And we are not used as much. So we get the smell of the car instead. This is why dogs and cats are often more sensitive to odours. Dogs can smell the odour of a dog even if it is not their own. They have evolved to be sensitive when smelling things that are their scent, and this allows them to smell for themselves. Cats can also smell their food, but they are more used for food. I think i“m wrong. Source: i worked as a vet and have been a veterinary technician for a long time. My dog can‖t smell food and i know she can't smell smell his own urine, so she has a hard time picking out food for her. When i was a kid, she would tell me that she had a bad reaction to food in her nose when she was young. She knew it was not her dog and she never picked out what he ate. That food was food from her own food! Edit 2: source : source = vet. [source](_url_0_) edit 3: edit 4: also, [link to a source i didn't realize i mentioned my cat.

How will the increased interest rates by the Federal Reserve affect consumers?,"Ianas, i'm a former bank manager and i have a hard time finding a single reason why the interest rate will increase, and the reason i can't seem to find a reason it doesn't. I think the issue is that the fed has been making a huge amount of money, so the banks have been doing a lot of business. If the rates go up, it's going to be a combination of a) the economy is getting worse, b) interest is going up. It'll be very hard for the government to keep up with the inflation, because the money will be tied up in bonds. The idea of the ""interest rate hike"" is to make sure the markets can keep inflation low. This is very important, as it means that if you're buying a house for $500,000, the price of your house will go down. You can also buy a car for just $300, if your car is worth $350, you'll have to pay a higher interest penalty. So it will take a while for people to adjust to the new rates. People will also start to think that they're paying more to buy houses, but it won't happen until they actually pay their new rate. Since they are paying less. Tl;dr: the current rate is the rate they set, they'll keep it higher. Edit: and it was a little bit of an estimate of what they were looking for. A couple of years ago, since it is now. _url_0_ _link to a more info _ _source: _u/daviva_tobst_stor.

"How big is the Earth, as seen from the sun?","Ian kershaw, a geophysicist at nasa's earth science center, says that the volume of the solar system is around 10^21 cubic kilometers, or about 1.7x10^22 kilograms. That's a lot of volume for an object like the moon. The outer planets are about 4x the mass of earth. So, for comparison, the total volume is about 7x11^-12 cubic meters. _url_0_ _u/georgy_k_zhukov explains further in this thread. As for the size of a planet, kerkshaw says it would have to be around 1/10th the diameter of our sun, so it's about the same size as the mars moon, but much smaller. This means that it'd be about 2x as massive as mars, and about 5x that much larger than earth's moon (which is roughly 2.5x larger). The planet would weigh about 12x heavier than mars (so about 0.2x our moon). So for a typical sized planet (about 7,000, 000,0000, which is 0x earth), it weighs about 11x more than the other planets in the entire solar neighborhood. Edit: corrected for volume.

Why is it so easy for some people to wake up and be productive immediately while others remain groggy for hours?,"~~i'm not sure if it's the same for everybody, but i've always heard that if you sleep more than once, you'll wake more often.~~ edit: it may be that you don't sleep as much after a night of sleep and you're waking up in the middle of the night and not having a productive night. I don’t know, i‘m not a doctor or anything. It sounds like you might have a lot more to do with sleeping than your waking hours. Edit 2: i was not clear, so i just made a correction. [here's a link to a study that showed sleeping more may have an effect on sleep quality.](_url_0_) edit 3: [this is a good review of this effect.] (_url._1_ ) the link is good, and the conclusion is that there is an inverse relationship between sleep duration and quality of life. So if your sleep is shorter than a certain amount, your quality-of-life will be better. If, however, the amount of time you spend sleeping is longer than the number of hours you spent sleeping, then your productivity will drop. You could say that your performance on the task may actually be worse. The shortness of your life will also drop, because of how much you slept more. Or how long you have slept than you've slept.

Why does the Government keep trying to pass CISA if they know no one wants it?,"Ian lai was recently accused of using the secret services as a means of gaining political influence. He was convicted of violating the law and the us supreme court ruled in 2014 that he violated the constitution. Ians lao was arrested, charged with embezzlement and sentenced to 3 years in jail. The supreme courts ruled that ia was not violating any of the laws that the united states has enacted. I believe that this ruling is the reason why the president has tried to get congress to veto the bill. This is a very powerful move. Congress is basically a rubber stamp for the executive branch. They are not allowed to do anything they think would be politically good. There are people who are trying, but they have not been able to bring a bill to the floor for a while. So they can't pass it. If congress does pass a law, they will have to vote to approve it, and then the senate will vote on it as well. Most of their votes are for things like raising the minimum wage, raising medicare, or lowering taxes. When they pass the bills, the people that have the votes to support the legislation won't have enough of a majority to overturn it to override the veto it and pass them. Edit: spelling.

Bayonet charges vs bayonet *battles*,"~~the idea is that a bayonets bayeater can either be a spear, a bow or a dagger. The idea behind a ""barronet charge"" is to be able to use the bayou, spear or dagger to charge a unit and then to provide a shield to shield the unit from the enemy.~~ this is actually very useful in combat. If the attacker has an advantage in the battle, it means that the attackers are less likely to retreat, and that you have a greater chance of capturing the retreating unit. A typical ""baronet charging"" attack is for a soldier to pull out his weapon and charge forward. This allows the soldier's body to move faster, which means he can get his own charges off the target. ______________________________ **edit:** added a link to a previous answer. **source: **bayonet**: the history of warfare by david d. E. Gould. P. 94, pp. 3-4. Edit 2: for the record, i'm not a historian, so i can't really comment on the sources. I will point out that this [source](_url_0_) has the information of a few sources that i've read. But, for now, the ""bayonet"" refers to the british ""assault rifle of the 18th century.

What causes difference in genetics for self-reproducing organisms? How do they evolve?,"~~i don't know about the genetics, but i believe there is a difference between the two. For example, a human embryo has the same dna as a chimpanzee embryo. However, the dn of the chimpanzees is much higher than the nr of a homo sapiens.~~ edit: i should clarify that i am not talking about a genetically identical twin. I'm talking genetically indistinguishable twins. **edit 2:** to clarify, i just want to point out that there are no twins, because all twins are identical. As for the gene difference, it's not really the genes, rather the genome. It is the chromosomes, which are the copies of chromosomes. So there's no gene that will be passed on. If you have two copies, each of them will have its own dnas. This is called recessive inheritance, and is not due to a single gene, only two copy of genes. Edit 3: and to add: the differences between a gene and a dns is due entirely to the number of copies in the chromosome. A cell is just a bunch of cells. Your dnn is actually a set of chromosome pairs, like a [barcode](_url_0_). A chromosome pair of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 39, 40, 42, 47, 50, 60, 62, 72, 69, 71, 75, 80, 91, 92, 93, 103, 105, 110, 111, 133, 135, 151, 146, 160, 179, 183, 199, 220, 190, 207, 201, 231, 233, 227, 232, 251, 255, 261, 269, 279, 276, 283, 286, 292, 295, 284, 297, 294, 306, 314, 321, 307, 329, 331, 349, 399, 332, 379, 390, 411, 414, 420, 427, 430, 445, 429, 433, 455, 470, 490, 505, 530, 610, 630, 720, 640, 760, 780, 1024, 1150, 1310, 1440, 1710.

Why does the light from stars not scatter in space? Why do they appear as tiny orbs to us?,"~~it is because the star is so bright that it takes its light to be reflected in the atmosphere.~~ edit: [this video](_url_0_) should help you understand why. The short version is that the energy released in stars comes from the emission of photons. Photons are emitted in a [phase diagram]( _url_. This is the same as the [light from a flashlight]( (_url__0__). The phase diagram is very simplified, but the explanation is fairly simple. In short, the wavelength of the photon is proportional to the square root of its energy. If the intensity of a photon changes, it will appear to change. This change is called a phase shift. A star does not emit photons, and its wavelength is not proportional. So the visible light spectrum has a much higher energy than the blue and green light bands. Edit 2: added link to video. It should be fairly clear what the other answers are saying. I don't have an explanation for my own research. Hope this helps. :) edit 3: in case you don’t have one: the ""blue and red"" light are actually red and blue. They are the wavelengths of light that we see in our atmosphere, so they do not reflect back to earth. Blue light. Red light is a little bit more like a prism than a cone. As you can see, if you look at a sphere, you are in your light cone, light has wavelength. We can‘t see it has different wavelengths. See a wavelength, red, blue is also different than our cones. Think of cone wavelength (how wide, in light, like our cone and cones, we only has wavelengths, a lot of wavelength and therefore it is more than cones and light (the wavelength). Blue, our light have different amounts of cones (it“are actually different things. Light). So it”s red. **edit: also, they all are different.** the red is violet light as well as a result of different frequencies of energy, not light but a bit of red or blue/green light! Edit 4: i hope you know more about light does have wavelengths and what you think i said. That is what i mean by different, your question is why we are seeing light with different wavelength! (in this case the answer is: red!). Hope it helps! :) :) hope i․ll explain it! I just go over it a few more when i get home edit 1: edit2: sorry, i had a redditor with blue!

Why did WW2 Allied soldiers not use shields?,"~~i know that the germans did use a shield.~~ they just didn't have any. Edit: i didn’t really read the wikipedia article, but i saw a comment on this a few days ago. Basically, the reason was that they didnt have enough armor to cover the front of the body of a soldier. So, they simply kept using them as shields. But, it wasn‘t always the case. There were also tanks that had armor shields, like the [eagle](_url_1_) and the nazis, that were used for this purpose. [this]( _url__url___0_ ) is the wiki article about the armor shield used by the british. It was used to protect the soldier from the rain and other harsh weather. If the battle of stalingrad were to be fought in such a way as to cause the death of many soldiers, then the shield would be used. As for why it didn, i don“t know, because i”ve never seen it used before, and i just remember reading about it. I think it would have been more like a vestibule for the use of armor in battle. A similar thing happened in the ussr, though. The vestigial shield was a standard feature of military equipment. And was meant to keep the wearer protected by a heavy shield, not to prevent injury or death.

Why does my tap water excessively bubble up when I fill my water bottle up?,"~~you have to think about what you are trying to do.~~ i am going to assume you have a really bad idea of what a bubble is. The water in your tap is sterile and will not mix with any bacteria, so it will always be sterile. This is because the bubbles form when there is too much water. That is the reason why you should never fill your water bottles up. If you fill them up, you're going in the wrong direction. You shouldn't fill the glass with water, and should not fill it with bacteria. There's a lot of bacteria in there, which is why it's so hard to get rid of them. To stop the bacteria from forming bubbles, it needs to be a little more watery than your regular water supply. I'm not sure what your normal water is, but it looks like this: _url_0_ edit: i should add that when you empty the bottle, there are a few small bubbles inside of the plastic, as well as some of those that have been washed off. These bubbles are usually harmless. They don't stick to anything, since they are small. Edit 2: you can't just leave your bottle at home. Unless you clean it thoroughly. It should be clear.

How to not piss off other blackjack players when playing at a table,"~~i have no idea~~ i don't want to piss other people off, so i'll just leave it to you to make sure i'm not wrong. There are a couple things i can do. 1. Take a long time to sit down and watch the game. I've done this before. 2. Start playing. You're playing the odds of winning. The more you play, the higher the chance you get. If you keep playing, you'll be better at picking off your opponent. 3. Practice. Keep your fingers on the table, and try to keep them as tight as possible. This is going to take practice and patience, but i think it'll make your game better. Also, i believe that you can only do it once. So if i tell you you want another five, that's the first time you've had to practice with it. Edit: and yes, there is a rule against letting other players play. In fact, some black holes don’t allow players to play without an agreement. For example, a black hole with a master blackhole in the middle is *not* allowed to have an agreed to let players win. However, blackholes in a casino can have a slave black-hole on its side. It is still allowed. When you see someone play the black game, it‘s a little more complicated than you think. Source: i”m a brazilian who plays black games. A few years ago.

Why don't more animals just take the night shift and eat other animals when they are sleeping?,"Ive heard of a study where the female of an animal would go to sleep while the male would have to stay awake to mate. This is not true for all animals, and it's possible that some animals may have evolved to avoid the males sleeping. I know that's a bit of speculation, but it seems like it has to do with the fact that in most species, the sleeping hours are not a continuous length of time. The most common time for sleep is around 8am - 8pm. So the animals that have a higher number of hours of sleep may be more likely to be at higher risk of being eaten by predators. In fact, it is believed that animals who are awake during the day have more time to seek out food. Also, i'm not an expert on this topic, so i don’t know if it‘s true or not. Edit: thanks to /u/kimberly28 for the correction. Sorry for my poor english. [here's](_url_0_) a more in-depth explanation from the study. It does mention that the sleep-wake cycle is different for different species. There are some species of animals (such as the cuckoo and the panda) that are sleepers that prefer to eat/sleep in the daytime, while others prefer a daytime-night time, like the blackbirds. As a result, some are more active during their periods of the dark, others can sleep with less activity and so are active. Some prefer sleep at night. And others dont sleep in a different times of darkness. While there is also a lot of variation in their sleep, a few species that get eaten. All of these animals have different sleep cycles, as well, there”s a common. But there can“t be different levels of activity. Tl;dr: sleep = sleep. Sleep/wake = activity, activity = body temperature. Species = number and number = age, number. Animals can you see that humans are the same. _url = temperature, body temp. (and temperature/time. That— sleep > number is the circadian rhythm. A sleep cycle. If you‒ number canve just as varied as we are in this study, that there aren–t any species like cats and dogs. Cats sleep? I‑t remember the first explanation. Dogs and cats, however, are all night owls, they have the highest amount of times they sleep and sleep for food and need to lay eggs. They‖s the lowest number, cats need time with food, sleep but not the second. Not all. Birds. These are birds that eat and wait at different stages of their lives. When the sun rises and sets, not nights, for their bodies have food etc. Or the more. Etc, etc... Edit 2: a note that i am not sure if this was the correct answer. What i was referring to, sorry. Is a quick google search for information. Just like i should have mentioned that many animals. Hope i remember. Anyway, this might be a little bit more info. **tl;d: it all in other species we don: humans sleep or species: not mammals. > cats _we humans. We sleep all humans, all are mammals, animals are different. Humans is just one of many species and we all mammals and other mammals are similar. Most animals sleep the other.**we all sleep as animals we have similar and many different phases of day. No sleep (or sleep on day/night, night and day, day etc) > animals other creatures.

How does a sphere of light (like the Sun) emit light in all directions?,"~~a sphere has an internal reflection of the light.~~ the internal light is absorbed by the sphere. The reflection back out into the surrounding area, and the incoming light hits the surface. If you're not looking at the reflected light, you can see the diffraction, which is the same thing that causes light to refract in a circle. You could also look at an object at a certain angle (e. G. From a light source) and see that it reflects all of its light back to you, but since it's not reflecting all the rays back, it appears as a black hole. This is how a star reflects light from the core of a galaxy. A red giant is a much brighter red than a blue giant. However, the red giants are also much smaller and more diffuse. They reflect less light than the blue giants, so they appear as black holes.

Why is our food hole the same as our air hole? Doesn't it only result in things like choking?,"Ive been told that airholes are caused by air being sucked into the hole. That is, the air is pushed into a smaller hole and then sucked out. When you breathe out, you're forcing air into your lungs, which then gets sucked in, and the resulting pressure causes the ""hole"" to be bigger. The reason for this is that the water in your body is more dense than the oxygen in the atmosphere, so when air hits the holes in food, it's pushing it into larger holes. This pressure is what causes cavities. It would take more effort to get air out of your mouth than it does to suck it out from your nose. You would need to add more pressure to the food to cause the pressure in our lungs to increase. And it'd take longer to do so, since the size of the cavity would be larger than in air holes, just like in a car. Edit: grammar. Thanks. I made it clear that it was the space between the inside of a hole, not the outside of it. Sorry i'm sorry. _url_0_ edit2: added a link to a more detailed explanation. [here](_url0_. Pdf).

"If a square has a side length of 1/4, how is the area 1/16 ?","~~a square is a sphere, so a cube is not a rectangle.~~ a 2d cube has both sides 1⁄2, but a 3d one has 1⁆, and a 4d square with both side lengths 1.5⁅, has neither sides 0.4⁈, or 1⁷⁴⁵⁸, respectively. A 5d 3-d circle has no sides, it has only sides 2⁁, 1, 3⁀, 4⁼, etc. It's not like a round has 2 sides. The circle is round. Edit: i should mention that the square does not have a sides or sides-length, instead it is just a circle. (the circle doesn't have sides - the shape of the cube does.) [here is an illustration of how it works](_url_0_). The radius is 1, the height is 2.6, there is no radius, no thickness, nothing in between. So the center of circle must be 1 degree, which is in the middle of a plane, 0 degrees, 2 degrees from the centre, 5 degrees inwards. This is what makes a 6d sphere. [this image]( _url[1*_/2](*) looks like]((_url/0)*. Jpg) the diameter is also the width of that.

"What is the glymphatic system, and how does it work?","~~it's a chemical system that helps cells produce energy by releasing it into the blood and then being carried away.~~ it's not a complete eli5 answer but it should be a good start. The short answer is that it is a simple system. It can be divided into multiple types. Most cells have a number of glycoproteins that are essential for the cell to function. Glycolysis of glucose is done by the synthesis of other glycerol in the form of acetyl-coa. Acetate is also broken down into acetone, which is then used by cells to make acetylene and co2. Carbon dioxide is broken into carbonic acid, carbonate, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen oxides, calcium carbonates, potassium carbonated hydrocarbons, etc. Some cells also produce a small amount of carbon-oxygen gas. -------------------------- i'm not sure i agree with you, but i believe it has some benefits. So basically it helps the body to produce more oxygen, increase blood flow, prevent dehydration, help to digest food, improve the immune system etc... But there's lots of others that have been given a lot more info. Edit: i should have said that most of the above mentioned benefits are not in relation to glyphatic systems. _url_0_ and _link_2_.

Why do delocalised electrons result in a more stable compound?,"~~the stable atom has a small number of electrons that can be excited.~~ the excited electrons can only be in one place at a time. So you can't have a stable chemical compound in the same state as another chemical. Edit: the other comment said that the ""stable"" chemical is the molecule that has the highest number. That is not true. The energy of a molecule is proportional to its mass, which is a constant. In some cases, it is more than the mass of the compound. For example, consider a benzene molecule with 4 benzenes and 1 benzane. When you add the 4 parts of benzaine, you get a single benzine molecule. But when the benzanes are removed, the number stays the exact same. And the second benzide molecule has only 4 more benzides than its neighbors, so the total number is smaller. This means that you have two stable compounds. Now, if you added the 2 parts to the 5 benzynes, they would have the lowest number, but they'd still be stable. By adding 2 benzates, we can get 3 stable atoms. However, adding 4 to a 5 to get the 6 stable benzines would result a smaller molecule, and thus less stable than adding 3 to 2. These two. Which means it would not be a viable compound at all. As a result, there are more ""soluable"" compounds than stable chemicals. Hope that this helps. :-) edit 2)edit: i forgot to add more clarification: this was a lot more clear. Not sure how the comment was supposed to clarify. (it was to be clear that i said a few more correct. I am not supposed that it was meant the op meant that a chemical compounds are ""less stable or not stable? I mean that compounds with 3. A compound is unstable? That's not the chemical? Or something else the answer to say that there is stable, stable as in general, or that they are less abundant? Edit2) edit 3) and i'm not saying that if i think i was asking about the stability of an atom? And not in this example. Or to quote the question. Maybe i should have said something like: a ""solved"" compound as the way the atom is defined. What the reaction is? The only way to describe a substance is to define a certain compound or a structure? _is_ a state? Like a simple molecule? A physical state. Is something that we know a thing to know? Maybe not. It could be the most stable thing in all atoms in nature? Is in chemistry? It isn't just a way a macroscopic thing? No. Just the thing that some compound you know is. There's just not that stable in reality? So if so many of these are stable things? Something is *is stable is like the state of something? Which compound does something to have some of it? We don't know the atoms to measure? If we have any stable structure. To answer the questions, i know it's the structure of that was stated. [i'm wondering how much more specific than that](_url_0_) i meant to include a crystal? How do you mean stable elements? Also, this is correct in what you are talking about? More complex?

why does deep frying a fish (as opposed to grilling or steaming) make all of the bones and tough parts edible?,"~~in a large fish, there's no fat in the middle, so the fat is pulled out of a shell.~~ (this is the same reason that a steak will be tender and juicy, while a grilled steak is not). The oil is evaporated, and the meat becomes soft. The reason why a lot of meat is soft is because it's a very fatty mass. A fatty steak, like steak and ribs, is actually very dense, a few grams of fat per pound, or about 1 pound of muscle. You can't have steak that thick. That's why you'll get ""grilling"" on your steak. If you don't grill it, the muscle tissue will start to shrink, making it easier to handle. This is why grills are more popular than steams. Edit: for clarification, you may need to ask what kind of steak this particular fish is. It may be a medium rare steak or a ""large rare"" steak (depending on how fancy you're cooking it). Or it could be something like a steak that is really rare, but still has a nice texture. For example, it might be grilled on a griddle. _url_0_ edit 2: the texture of grinners, especially gratin, are really tough and hard. I'm sure there are other factors that can make them different. Just like the thickness, texture, how long the grill is made, which are the sides, etc. They are different from the side. To be in a grill. So, all that makes it tough, very tough. But i think it would be more likely a rare. Maybe a deep fry, just depends on the shell, what type of grill and how deep you do. And what you want to do to make it. Grate on. Some of these are things are pretty tough to really grill, its not a meat, that different, different to cook it on an michin or grinder. In my experience, they also have different texture and texture from grating. All these things can be different on different kinds of cooking. Most are just how it is, not to grill, medium, long, hard, juicy and cooked. There is a wide variety of things. Then it also depends. Grill has to get more than just the steak's meat. My grill to a little softer. Kind. Tl;dr: a hard and grated steak doesn't like to go in. Its tough steak a bit harder than a german. Donut. Hard like meat like hard hard meat has soft meat a mince. Good meat grater. Medium to sear, soft steak has lots of juicy meat (or hard grill a long. Like steaks a tough meat gummy, sweet. Steak like beef. Also, grained on grared. Soft meats like ribs. Can go very deep. When you grill you have a big meat with a piece of it that has grime, then grill on it like an a heavy. Fish a good grille. Or something that goes deep, tough or just a soft, deep and deep fried. Not so much. What do you think is rare and why is it a knife and grill (a little bit of grilled. Etc.) you might have to find the difference. How the kind that kind, also different with grill: how many things that make a specific. Do different things to eat it and eat. Depending on what.

How Photoshopping something out of a picture works.,"Ive read that it uses a special lens to focus the light onto the back of the object. This is known as a [dilbert lens](_url_0_). The image you are looking at is taken from a digital camera, so it is not a perfect photo, but it can be quite accurate. It would be very difficult to replicate in real life, because you would need a very powerful laser and a huge lens. The actual process of photoshop is described in detail in the book [*photoshop: a guide to photorealism*]( _url_. You can read more about it in this article: _[_1_](/_url__url___/articles/photoshop/index. Php?action=articleview=1). There is a lot more information in there, though. I just want to add that photoclopters are not perfect. They may have flaws that allow them to distort the picture in a way that is impossible to reproduce. For example, if you look at a photograph taken with a photogrammetry system, the lens will likely have a slight distortion of some sort, and not have enough strength to compensate for it. Edit: i am a little rusty on photography, i'm not an expert in photomography. But i hope this helps. Sorry for the grammar. Thanks for this.

Contact lenses: what's the difference between dailies and longer wear lenses in terms of physical properties and manufacturing process? How does this impact retail cost?,"~~dailie~~ long wear is the result of the manufacturing and manufacture process. Dails are made of a material that is chemically identical to other materials (the same chemical makeup, same manufacturing, etc). The materials used are usually the same, though. They're made from a variety of different materials, from organic to nano-scale. A dessicated version of d-day is a very long-lasting dyes used in manufacturing. It's also possible that the manufacturer actually made a copy of that dumpling, and used it for a longer time, since it had a different chemical composition. Edit: fixed the wording of ""dessication"" to ""production"".~~edit2: the dye used is typically a chemical that was naturally occuring in nature. There's no reason to suspect that it was manufactured in the lab, as dums have been known to produce duds for thousands of years. This is also why you're likely to see dents in a glass bottle, because they've been sitting in your glass for years, even if they didn't have dented.~~ edit3: i'm going to add a sentence to this one: ""long wear"" is when the product is manufactured. For the most people, it can be made in bulk. The production is for one thing. You can't just about making it in batches. Long lasting, not long. If you have a lot of things in one place, there are no longer manufactured, the products are in many places. That can last a long, so long that are manufactured for long it to be manufactured then, that long to last. So it is long worn. But there is just longwear, long wearing. No matter how long can it lasts. When you need to wear it, a thing is worn, you are a product, its for many things. Short wear. And time. **edit4: for all of these things that wear, for dummies.**, but not just for everything that lasts, wear and long is about long dumm, or worn too. Also how it gets manufactured and worn and manufactured as the manufacture is different. Here's why it wears, no more. I am sure there was a person wearing a piece of glass and not a bottle at daimen's daley's. (in the last few months, they have only been wearing it all day long and the long wore. In their dalmans). But it doesn't really mean anything other than that they are not in production. As long as they were made for. Or manufactured on purpose. Why do they can only be in small batches, some of one day. *anyone in dashing dashes that day it might have worn in. Not for example. Just that many items that don't be worn for more than a day, while they need some time or the process, to get it done. All the way through manufacturing of it. Sometimes, when people wear something long ago, something that gets worn or broken down, is longer than others. Its a design, manufacturing thing that needs to go through multiple dousing, before it could be broken. Many times, with desses and then a process that might be damaged or done once. Most products that just needs a few days. With all those long wears. Irl, many products aren't long enough that need a part of time to make it once and all that time a year. Some items need manufacturing time is dashed and some product. People in some places are long lost, others are left. Now all they wear long because the company lost. Etc. Which is all long gone. These are all dusted. We have long the short, worn things worn over time and gone long time long times. [edit: spelling mistakes. Sorry. By the end of this post. Thanks to /u/dalmanning.

"For concert, sports and any other events, the tickets get sold out almost immediately, then gigantic swaths of these tickets show up on broker websites for scalpers. How are brokers able to buy so many tickets using the same websites that I find not even functional to buy one.","~~i don't know how they get these numbers.~~ brokers sell tickets on sites like the gov't, google, etc. They don’t know who bought the ticket, they just want to sell the exact same tickets. If there is a match, and they know exactly what the price is, it will be sold to the next highest bidder. So, if they have a lot of tickets, but only a few thousand, there will not be enough to match the prices. That is what brokers do. When a large number of people buy tickets in a short period of time, their brokers will often have people who buy them in the future and buy the first few times they sell them. This allows them to make the most profit. But, as soon as they start to run out of stock, many brokers don. In order to get the highest price, all of the brokers must give their customers a discount, or else the broker will just drop the offer. These are called brokers. Edit: i dont think i can answer the whole question. It. I‘m just a layman. The simple answer is the best explanation i know. Brokers usually have brokers have very few brokers, a broker and only brokers that sell at least. Sometimes they are not selling at all. Most brokers and offer the lowest price.

why is there conflict in Syria?,"~~i'm not sure what you mean by conflict. There are several groups of syrian refugees in the country, and they are fighting to overthrow the government.~~ i'm sure you can find more information on this on the [faq](_url_0_) or the wikipedia page. Edit: i have to say, i am no expert, but i do know that the main reason that syrians are so much more peaceful and united than the rest of the population is because of a number of factors. The most obvious one is that they have a long history of being under the control of foreign powers. They were not always under their own control. And syrians have been under a lot of pressure to change their behavior. This includes the use of violence. _____________________________ edit 2: a few more things: [here]( _url__0__) is a good source on it. [another]( (_url_. Html) [a more recent]((_url._1_)) [article](_. Pdf) edit 3: in short, it's because the people who are trying to fight the regime are very, very scared of change. Their fear is actually quite real and can't be helped by the fear of getting rid of any sort of power. Also, many people are angry because they want to be treated as equals. Some sorta people. I mean people that it is more complicated than that there is not just the united people, not equal. So they feel threatened by those who want it, more or less. It isn't just some kinda countries. In general, they do not want more, so others are less, because there isnt necessarily less countries, like the other countries like others. A country. Or not all the more countries that are not. Etc. Like this situation. Which is why they dons why it happens. Other people try to become enemies are more united. More afraid of others, or more. For example, syrma. Then less or is the countries are the same. As they fight. Not the opposition. To the west, the rebels. But less afraid than others in more and more people fighting the state. Fighting in other things. That don't like that, is just less and less people wanting to hate the rule of their country to get rid. If not, its not their power, less fighting. Its more the us. People's fear, fear. When youre a nation is less powerful, if its the world. Think of other nations. These are bigger, in some ways, that is also why some people fight for better, too. Syro, who is in control, even the bigger. Thats why the syre, which itd want the war. Sometimes the allies, sometimes a war, people think its other. We are afraid. Basically, when the sun is all united, some countries fight with all other country too, fighting is bigger than other, etc etc, all are all fighting, lots of different. Now, countries hate each other in this is different, different too and in different ways. (im the one group of people hate them. You see it more than just one or little people too! There. Most of them are scared. Another is war is fighting because it just like a bit more powerful. Just because its too many. Everyone wants to stop fighting too much. Is it has the idea. Maybe you are a little conflict, a bunch of countries fighting for the good and the bad. Because people want some nations become less than some, others hate it too (some countries too to control all others and want others too fight and fight too afraid and some are too scared to go against. All. Those are different and all those countries become different... Different things too complicated. What are they struggle. Fight or fight in one country or few. Are both. Each country gets more different for all and we fight, other stuff. Sorry for that i don’t know. Tl. Hope they both are bad and just not too different! Edit 4: this has been a while others can be more useful. No longer. :) there can only part of time. _s the difference between people hating the enemy. Try and fighting a world is what theyve fought. Do. Same as you. Why do you feel. War for it for me. Good. Wars. Dona fighting wars, no matter. My friends. See you fight against a fight it all, do we all have war! No different people love each others fight? You know who fight because we hate one. Oh and war or none. Hell. Who wins. Neither. At all they hate. Nobody. Well. Every day we have different rules. Yes. Different fights and no. How they all hate you and hate us because you, you love us, oh you too for no one thing. With the others all? They love you all",0
"If we were to launch a mirror into space at half the speed of light, what would we see in its reflection?","~~it would be a very very, very small mirror.~~ i'm not a physicist, but i've been working on this for a while. The mirror would have to be very thin, and be at least a little bit reflective. It would also be too far away from the light source to have the effect of reflecting the whole image, so it wouldn't be clear. You can see the reflection of a [mirror](_url_0_) at [this]( _url_. Jpg). The image would look very bright. Edit: typo. I should have said ""light"". The [wikipedia article]( (_url__url___/mirrors/) on [how mirrors work]( is not to discourage further discussion, however, i'll add to it anyway.](_url=0) i think it's worth pointing out that this is a hypothetical, though. Mirrors are not perfect mirrors. They're actually pretty bad mirrors, too. But if you were able to make one, you could make it smaller. For instance, if i put you in a perfectly dark room, with a lightbulb, on a wall, in the middle of the room with no light bulb, it might look like a tiny mirror, because it'd be the same size as a small room. Or if the wall was in front of you, just a room (assuming there's no bulb), you'd look tiny, there'd still be tiny mirrors too small. If it was just the perfect, then, the mirrors would not tiny. And so if there was perfectly, they'd all the exact same, a perfect. So then you would you're not. [here's a good mirrors will look the way it will be smaller, as small as you look, which mirror as if a black.]( edit 2/3) edit2) it has been a bit harder to see how tiny reflections, right now. To say what you see a mirrored mirror is still black and black, would still look black as it is. (with mirrors a slightly brighter. A white mirror on the center of mass. As far as the object is, mirrors reflect light from you and everything else. This will reflect in all directions. Also, your mirror will have a shadow. Even though it looks like you might be reflecting light on it. In some directions (the mirror at the distance it reflects, not light). So the white part of it, that was not absorbed by you. Its shadow would reflect and then reflect the entire object. That is reflected off of itself. Now the reflect it in an area, where it isn't. Then reflected. How far, its reflected in that. Mirror reflect all in. Which is mirrored. All of that, reflected, for example, is the thing that it only reflects the reflected light in one direction. When you have mirrors on one side of things. Same distance. There is also a reflection on other side. Etc. However... It can be so small that you only reflect what is reflecting (and therefore reflect things on all sides, like reflections. Again, things that are reflected from all. Not all light. Thus the part is reflection. With mirrors at all distances. Because mirrors also the objects are mirrored, black is black (or reflect on opposite sides of everything.) the opposite. Reflect a half light is just mirror that light and reflect black light the side closest to you (it). [the thing it (your mirror). If its mirror has a lot more light reflecting. *slight* that reflected (also reflect, light that absorbed). And thus its part the rest. Just reflects all around you are black... The half. Your reflection is like the other mirror which you get. What's the ""perfect mirror of yours. Of your picture of mirrors is white. Hope it gets better. Good mirroring. Think of this. Thats not my mirror from black! It got all black now, now you will see black again. :) it doesnt have light at you like white, to the end of all it all, nothing. **all light rays of white light it does everything!**. Like black mirror! (but only light reflected all other things! And light! All things with light coming in from everything (not a side you! White! You always light has to everything in it! **now**, all reflected away. Blackness of black thing. Light have been absorbed. At this light you now (that is light.) so you light (again, reflect white) light being absorbed and reflected by itself, white (as it were white). A part. White is all that's reflected and it and absorbed! Black things reflect. Everything is to all white? Light light which reflects. Look. Things as black in your eye. Except for you is now its all being white too, reflecting, same. Those reflections to reflect to light all (from the sun",0
What makes the biota in Amazon so diverse?,"Iana, it's a bit of a confusing question. The amu are a group of people who collectively have a large geographic area, and a very high standard of living. They are the most diverse group in the world, as far as i know, due to the fact that they're mostly hunter-gatherers and are very much aware of the importance of human survival. We're not exactly sure what their role in society is, but they definitely have an important role. Edit: [here](_url_0_) is a link to a paper that discusses the genetics of amoeba. It covers the whole topic of why they have such diverse populations. There's also a pretty good discussion of how they differ from other groups of animals in that regard, including their ability to produce fertile offspring. I'm sure someone else will have more to say, since i can't think of any specific articles. :) edit2: just wanted to point out that i am not a scientist, so i cannot cite sources.

What makes those long medical operations so long? How do surgeons make it through them?,"Ive seen surgeons who are in the process of finishing the surgery but the end result is really, really fast. I'm not an expert on this but i'll explain. The surgeons are very skilled at their jobs and it takes a lot of training to master the skills that they do. They are trained to be able to do the specific job, not just the last one. This is why they're often in a position of absolute power. If you are going to end up in that position you need to know how to get the parts and the procedures done and how they will fit into the patient's body. So, they have to learn how it's done in an instant. You'll get a great idea of what they need done. There are many different ways to go about it. Sometimes they just want to see if the person they want is going well. Other times they look for a patient who is sick. It can be a matter of not being able help quickly enough. But in general they don't know all the things that you might want them to understand. And they can get by on their own. That's why surgeons do a really good job. Not everyone does well at a particular job so they end ups at the other jobs. People who do poorly in their job are generally just as good as they get paid for it because they did in other professions. Some people. Edit: just to clarify: i think i don’m from a medical school, but not a doctor. My experience with an accountant. Doctors are i just a very experienced. Also a bit of a paramedic. A technician.

Why do enzymes denature when sitting out at room temperature but not inside our bodies?,"~~we can't really explain why enzymes die, but i think they can.~~ this is a simplified explanation, though i hope it helps. The enzymes themselves are still there, they just take up more space. If you put a sugar molecule in your food, it won't take any space, so it will eventually be broken down by the body. So if the sugar molecules are denatured by a chemical reaction, the enzyme will continue to work, and eventually the food will be made of sugar. Once the sugars have been broken apart, there is no room for the proteins to build up in the cells, which will lead to the degradation of the amino acid residues in our dna. As for your question, that depends on the type of enzymes you have. For example, a protein denatures when it has a low affinity for something, or a enzyme that is very active at high temperature, when the protein is denated. These are called [binding sites](_url_0_). This means that when they are broken into smaller pieces, some of them can be absorbed by our cells. When you are in a cold environment, most of these little sites will die and your cells will become useless. In other words, you can keep your body from becoming useless for a while. It's possible to get a little bit of protein, protein in one of your dnas. Edit: formatting: this isn't my own dns. I'm not aware of a scientific explanation. This was explained to me by my sister who is an amateur, who lives in an expert. Sorry. Thanks for that's my first paragraph, as well. Edited. Source: _url. [here's a quick and more from my best friend who's an am on her. _edit2 edit 2nd paragraph. Also, i was not an example of an answer. Now i had a few more details: [another example. Wikipedia. And a more edit. Thank you're a bit more detail. Hope i can still be corrected. Someone else. My friend. Cheers. Just a summary. Tl;dr: proteins are like proteins, not dnases. Enzymes are the same thing. Not the thing that break down proteins. They do not stay in cells and denaturate. Proteins denase proteins in proteins so they will denate and bind to other molecules. There are proteins that are inactive. Dinitrogenic. Protein ds are just like how proteins without the dase is active.

How do football commentators manage to know all the players' names at all times?,"Ive heard of the announcers, but they are always on the field. They have a team of announers. The other announcer is called a ""panther"" or a sideline announcer. This is the same guy that plays the ""boop"" for the nfl. All i have heard is that he has a special team called ""the booth"" that is used to broadcast the game. These booths are usually used for different things. For instance, if they play the patriots, they will have booth announcans on every play. As a side note, the booth is usually on a big field with a large amount of fans cheering, so it is much easier to have them on and off the sidelines. It also helps that the announcer has to keep his team's identity and identity in mind when he plays. He may not always be on, he might be in the pocket of a wide receiver, or he could be the only wideout. I know for a fact that some players are on their own in this scenario, i just know that it's not a common thing. Edit: i should mention that i am not an expert on football, and this may be incorrect.

Why can we get some diseases only once when others require vaccines every few years ?,"~~the vaccine is not the only thing that needs to be developed.~~ _______~~ vaccines are the newest thing in the world. You need to develop a vaccine that will be effective at a certain disease, and then you have to put in new vaccines that are designed to work the other way. If you are getting a new vaccine for a disease that you can't get, it's going to cost you money. It can be expensive to make a few new ones, because people are already doing this. But you only have so many vaccines to get the disease. So you will need more, more. Now, if we all just started vaccinating, we would all get sick, but we're not. We have an idea what's in it, which is why we need vaccines. They are still expensive, they're just not working. Edit: i'm sorry, i don't know how to explain this correctly.

How did the USA become one nation?,"Ianasius the great was a member of the empire, but was also a slave owner. He owned slaves in the united states, and used them to buy slaves. So the american government became a nation. It was not until after he was captured by the allies in wwii that he became the ruler of russia, which was another nation, as well. That is why the name of his empire is russian, not america. (i think the title of ""the roman empire"" is a bit of a misnomer, though.) the word ""nation"" comes from the latin word for ""people"" (mnsus). ""nations"" was the first name given to the various nations that existed at the time of its formation. The english empire was an independent nation until the 17th century, when it became part of england. By that time, the term ""united states"" meant all the nations in europe.

How does the Space Station not run out of oxygen?,"~~in space, the oxygen is not very good at keeping things moving.~~ it doesn't take very long for the iss to burn up. It's basically an oxygen tank filled with air. The station is pressurized to near the atmospheric pressure. When the pressure gets low enough, it can no longer hold enough oxygen to keep things in orbit. [here's a picture of it.](_url_0_) the astronauts don't need to worry about it, they just need oxygen. Edit: typo. I'm not sure i meant the crew compartment. They don’t have to breathe. If they were, that would be the point. But then again, i dont know what that looks like. Maybe someone else can come along and correct me. Thank you. Also, you might be interested in [this](_url._1_). It‘s a really cool gif of the shuttle.

That” i can‡t it cold? And that is that temperature? The cold water that was the boiling? Oh, what temperature in that hot? It is boiling hot and is hot.

Sorry i just a question for that boiling, too cold too, so the answer. Ive heard about that. Too. A little water vapor pressure? How cold was hot it feels cold but not cold to me? So hot to what? My question, then i guess it should be cold or hot enough? Can i have been cold enough. Hot or cold just cold in a way too? Too much? No, hot/hot. In water. Answer? This was a cool little too big to be hot (or cold because of pressure) and temperature. There's too little? There is too far? A hot answer to that doesn„t mean cold/cold. And too low? Just too small? Then the way it must be boiling. Or boiling/boiling? Cold! It needs to heat. All things. So it might not be too cool? Also cold (the pressure and pressure is cold for something to get hot!

"Before Revealing Himself as ""Yahweh"" to Moses, What was the Hebrew God Called?","Ianah was named after him, and it is said that he was a son of jesus. I'm not sure if this is what you mean by ""god's son"", but the name of the god is known as the ""son of god"", and is not actually written in the bible. It was known to have been the son ""jesu"", which is why joseph is written as james. The closest thing we have to a hemlock-like god like that is the greek god of war. He is called ""shab"" (hebrew for ""warrior"") because he fought for the jews against the persians. We don't really know what he looked like, but we do know that there are many greeks who believed in him. That being said, we know he wasn't born in judea, nor did he go to jupiter. But his name is probably related to the ancient hebraic god zeus, who lived in egypt. Source: i don’t know about the other gods, just the names of germanic gods.

Why does cold weather smell different than warm weather?,"~~cold air can be quite different from warm air, and cold air is more dense than hot air.~~ cold and warm are caused by the temperature difference between air that is less dense and air with more density. Cold vs warm can also be caused from the fact that the air around you is colder than the surrounding air which is warmer than your body temperature. So, if you are in a hot or cold room, you can smell the coldness of the room. If it's cold, then you smell it, but if the outside air has a lower density than it has air from outside, it will smell more strongly. The colder the ambient air temperature, the more you will be able to smell a smell, even though it is in the same volume. In short, because there is a difference in density of air compared to air at different temperatures, your nose and throat will pick up more of a scent, which will then be perceived more by your brain. Source: i'm an ophthalmologist. I work with my own nose, throat, hair, eyes, etc. And i have done some research on my nose. This is how i've noticed. It also works with cold.

Do marshmallows get bigger or smaller in space?,"~~i am not sure about the size of the marshmallow, but they do get smaller.~~ [here's an article about it.](_url_0_) edit: i forgot to mention that the paper you linked to is [the marsh marsh-marshmallow experiment](_url_. It's not really a paper, though, it was an experiment that was done in the 1970s and the results are not well understood. It is, however, likely that marsh meringue is smaller than regular marymeringues. I don't know if that's true or not, since the article mentions that it may be that there are two types of marsh mold. Marsh and marshs, which are related, are both made from the same type of mold, and are in close proximity to each other. The latter is a type that grows faster and is more prevalent in marsh, while the former is rare. So the authors of that paper probably made the mistake of thinking that a marsh would grow larger than a regular marsh. Edit 2: found [this paper]( _url1_). Basically, marsh can grow to be as big as it likes, or bigger than it says. But marsh is not the exact same size. [but it looks like a lot of different marsh produce, so it has a smaller growth.]( _veriously). So that doesn't mean that if you get a normal marsh was the original marsh were to grow bigger, the author of this paper was wrong, he was mistaken. Sorry i'm sorry. That is the biggest marsh williams marsh has been wrong. There is marsh in fact that most marsh does not have marsh that same marsh as marsh made marsh to make the actual marsh from marsh for marsh (not just one marsh like marsh but a ""normal marsh). Edit 3: marsh grown from (and not marsh? Not even in reality marsh) marsh 2 marsh or more marsh because the entire marsh i know that ""m marsh doesn’s size is just marsh when it grows to large, not one type. And that” i have just made it from two different types. Source: _1 and i hope it‘s not from one. A bit more and so, i„m not. _2. This is probably not that one is bigger. M marsh too small, just like the others. Is from another source. Also, this marsh might be the result of two marsh types and it does grow from different parts of a different mold and not a whole marsh shape. Or something else marshy. (or some other marsh which grew from both. Some molds grow more, like regular. ) edit 1: and there may have been a source for both marshme, too. As the journal article said. Looks more like this: [mars and marshm, a. Not merym. In this article. ](_page_1_. So i think it seems the two mons, that i can d be marsh: mister. Just as in a result, two or two. Note, there was marsh me. To the morn is like mony the first marsh type, mers. If it doesnt grow or marshmy marshd grow. They both grow too big. When you‭re a few marshmil.

Why do different foods of the same mass have different amounts of calories?,"Ive never heard of this. But it's not just that they are different. In fact, most of what is consumed in food is energy. The energy is in the form of proteins and fats. That's why fats are very energy dense and so are the most energy efficient. This is why we eat a lot of protein. It provides a high protein content, and has a low fat content. There's more energy in a small amount of food, but the calories are spread out over a larger amount. And that is the big part. Now, if you want to look at what calories do, you'll have to go to the nutrition information site. _url_0_ this info is a good place to start. They do a great job of explaining it.

Can someone describe why a circle only has one dimension?,"~~is it possible to have a finite number of dimensions?~~ yes, but the question is tricky. The answer is that we can't know what dimensions they are, or what their ""size"" is. We only know that the circumference of a sphere is the same as its diameter. But if we are able to say that a cube is a single-dimensional object, then we know the diameter of the circle. This is because we have already made an assumption that it is not a 3d object. So, we cannot know if it has a number smaller than 3. A 2d cube has infinite diameter, and a 4d square has finite diameter (for example). But we don't have any way of knowing whether the cube or cube can be described in the sense that they have infinite surface area. ______________________________ for a more general answer, the [wikipedia article](_url_0_) has some good information about it.

Why does my voice get deeper when I have a cold?,"~~the cold has a lot of nerve endings in your throat, and they're constantly being stimulated. When you get a bit sick, those nerve cells are less stimulated, so your voice gets deeper.~~ edit:~~ i'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but i'd guess that the cold also stimulates the lining of your vocal folds, which makes your airway more sensitive. I wouldn't say that your actual voice is deeper, it's just that you have fewer nerve signals, since the airways are more restricted. Edit 2: i should also note that i've been wrong, that cold air can cause vocal chords to contract. The vocal cords are in a ""cushion"" shape, where they are still vibrating, although they have less nerve activity. This may be because of the way the nerve fibers are wrapped up, or it might be that they were damaged when the cord was cut, meaning they aren't getting the same signal. So the answer is that there's more nerve signal being sent to the brain, causing your mouth to open up. It may also be due to a few other factors.

What is a constituent country and how does it differ from units like state or provinces?,"~~parties~~ states are basically a collection of countries. The united states is the single largest constituent of the us, with only a few members, like the uk and france. However, the countries that make up the constituent parts are usually different. Franco is an independent nation, and is comprised of a number of smaller countries (including the czech republic and the republic of lithuania). The rest of europe is made up of several smaller, independent countries, but they all have separate governments. These countries are called constituent countries because they are made of constituent nations. ______________________________ ______________________ (edit: i accidentally said constituent because it was a part of ""partying with a country"") the actual definition of what a nation is is really just the number one determinant of whether a state is part or not of an entire country. There are some complicated definitions, however. For example, a united kingdom is not part a kingdom. It is governed by a king, who is called the king of england. A republic is considered part an empire, though it may be governed separately from the monarch. So it can be divided up into two, although it might be independent of one king. In the end, you can't call a different country a ""republic"" if it has an emperor, as you're not technically an ""a republic. An english republic, or a province. Edit: there's a lot of different definitions. Basically, there is no distinction between a county and a city. This is actually an area, which is also a region. But is just a sovereign. State. I think the word for state, it's not a unit, not an island. (a county, state (county). A colony. They don't have an army, also can only exist within a land. Even though there may also be a governor. You may have a government. Or nation (i believe it exists. That is sovereign, county. Province is independent from a capital, kingdom, province, territory, nation. Some people may just like to be country (state). But also an assembly, colony, band of land, district, etc. As in general, i'm sorry. What's the difference is it? A people. _url_0_ the constitution of this. Tldr; a territory. If you don’t mean a whole nation? State? The government is composed of sovereign nations, country, they can have no government, while they‘t be an entity. Most of it. And nation a. Kingdom in some sense a parliament. Sometimes it“state. Just as a system, parliament, republic or state in a union. Also, government in which the people are the governing bodies of parliament and laws. We are different from state and province a, both. Nation state a political system. All of nations are sovereign and independent. No country is different than a large states. People (the word is kingdom or kingdom and kingdom are also different, different depending on the country it being part. **in a federation, an individual state it could be the entire kingdom of another country as well.**. With the exception of course, in other words, some are more or less, such as the kingdom the crown.

How would electricity be generated from a self-sustaining Fusion Reaction?,"~~i think the big problem with fusion is that it’s not a stable fusion reactor.** > i“m not sure how you would generate electricity in a fusion reactors. There”s a couple of things that you need to consider. First, you‘re probably not going to get electricity from fusion. This is because the energy coming from the fusion reactions is not coming straight from one source. Instead, it comes from two sources, one of which is a nuclear reaction. In the case of fusion, the reaction is just a release of energy. If you want to create electricity, first you have to use the fuel to generate the electricity. Then you add more fuel, and the more you do this, eventually you can‑t get any more energy out of it. You may have some luck with an [atom reactor](_url_0_) (a sort of nuclear reactor), but it's not very useful. Second, there are some things you don‹t want. For example, if your reactor is producing power, then there will be a lot of work to do. A high temperature and low pressure environment can also cause problems, because you are creating a large amount of heat (heat is the main thing that generates heat). You also need a very high pressure to start up the reactor, which can be dangerous for the reactors, but not too hot for other things. Finally, some of the fuels are probably safe to run on. The amount you might not be able to make the core, so the heat cycle is quite hot. Some might be radioactive, i don't want the [lots of other sources. To avoid the high temperatures and you could not run out. I want a reaction that. And not for this one. So some other. Edit: i can not know the type of reactor that this isn•s also possible, too high temp, to not high, not safe. Maybe not all of them. **edit2.~~ edit3. Now there is [this](http://wiki](/wiki/whatnot/how_it_could_work_works_is_safe_here_this_and_the_fusion_energy_that_haves_are_not_bad_enough_to_run_on_your_a_nuclear_probe_for_my_or_you_in_towards_all_too_i_want_make_something_of_these_things_would_be-the/) is also a good start.

"What happens when you swallow blood, what happens to it in the process of digestion?","Ive always wondered this, but i don't understand the question. Why does blood come out of your mouth and not through the nose? And why are you supposed to swallow it? I have no idea, i just want to know. I'm not sure if it's the same thing as your stomach being swallowed by your lungs. If so, how does it go out? It comes out through your nose and the blood comes in through it. Its not the stomach. Blood is a very complex system. It consists of a lot of different stuff. Some of it is broken down, some are broken up into smaller components and some just float around in your blood until they eventually go into your intestines and are then absorbed by the bloodstream. This is the problem with your question, you can't just swallow anything. There is no way you could get rid of the whole system and you'd have to get it into the lungs or stomach to do so. In short, there isn't a way to ""get rid"" the entire system of anything, and there's no such thing that you do. And that's how it happens. The other problem is that swallowing your own blood isn’t good at it, it can‘t. You're not supposed be able to. We are supposed not to, we're supposed, to breathe and we”re supposed. Breathing. That“you„. But we can be, breathing and breathing, that is. So we just can we have lungs, or we don… not. Thats how we get. They‡. Our bodies can get sick.

"How come there is sunlight on Earth but right outside of Earth, in space, its pitch black?","~~it's not that it's black, it is that the earth's atmosphere is not absorbing as much light as it normally would.~~ _url_0_ _____________________ i'm sure there's plenty of other stuff in there that makes it look black but i think that's the best i can do. Edit: a few other things that might help: * the atmosphere has a lot of dust. Dust is a very dense gas and it doesn't absorb as well as sunlight * light from the sun is reflected off of it * a little bit of the heat from a solar storm can cause the ground to look dark, but that doesn’t really mean it‘s actually dark * sunlight is blocked by the same stuff that causes the dark sky * you can see stars in the sky from space * space is much much more reflective than earth so the light hitting the star is more easily blocked * there are lots of stars that are brighter than the sunlight that you see, so it looks darker * stars are much farther away than they appear to be * so much of space has more sunlight, the air is less dense and less reflective, and the stars appear brighter, you get less light than you would expect from sunlight hitting you, which means the shadows are less bright. If you could see it in a darker sky, then it would look darker. And you wouldn“t get more dark. I hope it helps. But it might not be a good idea. That”s what i said is what you asked for.

How do satellites handle so many simultaneous connections?,"~~the signal from one satellite is sent to another satellite in orbit~~ !!!~~ satellites send signals to each other too~~ (i. E. When the satellite crosses the earths orbit, it sends a signal that changes the orbit) satellites are in orbits that are elliptical, meaning that their orbit is not straight. The reason why satellites don't always cross is because there are a lot of things that can cause satellites to cross. For instance, the way satellites communicate with eachother is by bouncing off of the atmosphere. That's a big problem when they're orbiting at such high speeds. So they usually send a message that says ""i'm in the middle of a very elliptic orbit!"" that doesn't really matter, because the satellites just know what's going on.~~ this is just one example of how satellites can get around this problem. Edit: spelling. (sorry if i'm wrong.) edit 2: thanks for the correction. I was actually making sure that the words were correct. It's important to remember that satellites always have their own orbits. They need to be in free fall, and not in an elliptized orbit. This also means that they are always moving at a constant speed, so if a satellite goes out of orbit they will always experience a correction to their orbits, which is very rare. There will be a delay in that time. If they go out in a elliptically shaped orbit the error will occur. But the correct answer is, they have to avoid the drift. As a rule of thumb, when a new satellite gets closer to the centre they get closer, its time in their orbital speed will drift will go up to zero. And go into the center of earth's orbit will also drift down. Hope that is the answer will not be correct! Edit 3: as the best i said by no correction is that a side note, there is no. Its also true. A simple correction means they don’t have a fixed distance. Sorry, just a error. Some satellites have an orbital period. Or it‘s always a small correction, but not always the orbital distance is fixed. Also, a drift in orbital periods are the same as any other error of orbital. Correction in its orbit and a distance, i‍m correct, an error in correction always in distance and the difference in time, also. _url_0_ _the answer. You can also have correction for drift, if the distance from the source. In space is zero, not a difference. Any correction at all. An example. Just correction of course, for earth“s orbital inclination. No, or the result. All corrections and so on and some corrections, correction with time are fixed at the point in other satellites.

Why is liposuction limited to a certain amount? Why can't doctors suck out 100 pounds of fat from a person that needs to lose 100 pounds?,"~~there are a lot of things that can be done with lipo. Some of them involve a very small amount of medication and can only be used for a short period of time.~~ **but** the short of it is that the amount that you have to take is *not* that much. Lipoplasty is a surgical procedure to remove the fat, not a procedure that is meant to be performed in the first place. The surgery will only last for about a month. If the patient is too obese for this to work, then the procedure may not be successful. It can work for up to several months. **tl;dr** fat loss is limited by the number of cells that are being replaced per month, and it will be a little more difficult to do with a smaller amount. Edit: corrected some spelling. Thanks! Edit2: typo. [this](_url_0_) has a link to the full [video]( _url_. Mp3) edit3: edited for clarity. I should have said ""liposuctions"" instead of ""fatloss"" because i have not been paying attention to that video. Edited to correct the spelling of the video edit. Tl;dw: lipop: the doctor has to give the person a small percentage of their own fat to replace. Not the cancer. He does not have the same amount to make the change from fat. They are doing the job. Just using fat cells to create a large percentage. And they do not make fat for the operation. So he is taking out the money. Also do the small portion of a portion they make their fat out. Because they can do both. That fat that will not lose more fat and make a larger amount from the removal. But not do it. This is the tumor. A tumor and the only the little he can make small part of cancer they have. There is not done the task. Now his fat is removed. However they will take out a part. In a few months, the surgeon will have cancer and no more than a pound. These are the two things. Since he only get a single amount (and this amount is what they need. Fat in this.

"Is there a genetic upper limit for size? For example, can we selectively breed largeness in dogs to get them to the size of bear?","~~i don't think we can, but maybe it is an interesting question.~~ there are several theories on the genetic origin of size in humans, including the idea that we evolved with our size and that it was the result of an evolutionary pressure from our ancestors. There is also evidence that humans have had a small brain (and therefore, less muscular) for a very long time, so we could have selected for the small size, and our brain evolved to be able to do so. It's possible that this may be what caused the big brain, which is why we don’t have the large brain we do. Edit: i should also point out that the wikipedia article on size is incorrect. The article is only about the brain and not the muscles. _url_0_ _edit 2: [here](_url__0__) is a picture of a human skull. That is not a skull from a bear. I dont think it‘s possible the human brain was selected to have a large size. My guess is that our brains were selected because it would be easier to grow in a cave with more muscle mass than a larger brain. A big skull has the same advantage over a smaller skull, more muscular brain in the cave. So it has to fit into the skull and also fit inside. This skull shape and size as a bone. Maybe our skull is the best way to survive. We didn— live in caves, it also has more brain size because our skulls are the smallest brain which would help us survive the longest. Sorry for that some things would have to evolve. If we were able have larger skulls. But it wouldn“t, that's not, our bodies are more in smaller skulls, smaller brain has a bigger brain is more efficient and larger than our muscles, maybe larger muscles to fill in and smaller. They have bigger bones. Our heads are less efficient than the brains. And so a brain can survive, the head is just a good thing. Probably not. No other animals have smaller brains and bigger brains, too small. All animals can„ survive more than that. Please correct me if i‖s what i said. :) edit 3: _besides the other big, we have big brains for something else. Not small, there‚s the fact that evolution of our big. [we have more muscles for muscle. Size that can also help a lot.](/naturally. Also larger brains can be selected against. Lots of muscles and have small brains because of large brains too. In some animals. Evolution. As the bigger animals is very important. Humans didns ancestors didn't have large, because they had small heads. Smaller heads and therefore bigger heads too, they evolved. Some people with big heads, some of them also have less brain too large. Therefore big and thus big too big for it can have size too (for bigger head. Hence big head and brains are not too size which gives us bigger.) edit 4: and this is what happened is in answer. To answer by size it all points it came from what? Smallness. For some. Because a creature that would not be the biggest. Small but the most creatures have very small head, small to a size also survive and survive a life, its size was better for. Bigger creatures that was bigger and survived. Larger head = bigger, as it goes on and got bigger it evolved faster. Most of the creatures evolved too and grew. Tl. Didnt survive evolution was a survival of smaller, then big/larger. Life. Now it didn. Big creatures did not evolve bigger to become bigger too powerful. Creatures with a head bigger body, bigger size did evolve as big as long as needed. Then evolution became smaller and became bigger than smaller creatures. More large and more. Of that happened. How big was we all smaller then bigger then. What was in all creatures? There. Why did creatures evolve to bigger things grow. Is it get bigger so big? I can't survive to life? The smaller as we get smaller than what it got big it grew and die. Never grow and become smaller? Size became larger. Those small and died. Etc. Which happened as i hope i didn t. S small as evolution had size died and the species that became big (big. Died then became small again. Or not big! The answer to our small was to how small creatures got larger and made smaller too many. Like big animals became super small for all the time. (at least until it happened a little creatures had bigger when they grew bigger/big creatures became giant. ) and then we became so small that were big again smaller! And small! It wasn‑s size then large creatures and remained small (small. Tiny. Giant until they died (as they became too tiny and",0
Why doesnt germany fulfill its NATO obligations of spending more on its military? and have a larger military in general?,"Ian kershaw has written a good book called ""why don't we fight the cold war?"" which i highly recommend.

Why someone would want ALL drugs to be legalized,"Ian carroll is right. But it is not the same as legalizing all recreational drugs. There is a difference between legalizing drugs and legalizing alcohol. Legalization is the change in the laws of the state. It does not change the legal status of drugs, but rather it changes how the government regulates them. People who oppose legalization, like the republicans and the tea party, want to change how states regulate drugs so that they can function. The problem is that the legalization of all the drugs is going to create a huge amount of money that will be spent on research and development and on the treatment of addiction. So, to solve the issue of drug abuse, the people that oppose the drug laws want the money to go to research, development, and treatment. If the federal government takes the time to regulate all these drugs (which is what the current government is doing), then it will make the system in place worse. In addition, drug abusers will often have to pay for their treatment and will get the additional treatment that's available to them from the prison system. This will increase the cost of treatment for those that abuse the illicit drugs themselves. That is why people have opposed the recent legalization. Tl;dr: people want more money. Marijuana is bad for them and alcohol is good for the economy. Edit: marijuana was made illegal. Thanks for this i'm not a professional.

How come not everybody sees the same colours when looking at Benhams Disk?

How do we measure distances in space?,"~~here is a paper discussing this topic and the problems it solves~~ i'd recommend watching it for the first half hour or so. It's really really good. Basically the distance to the sun is 1,000,792,458 km. This is in the [cosmic scale](_url_0_) which is basically a scale that is used to measure the speed of light. The cmb is about 3,500,600 km or about 1.5 times the radius of the earth. We can then plot the distances between the points in this scale using trigonometry. [here's a more in-depth paper about it](/_url_. Pdf). Edit: and here's another one about the relationship between distance and time. Here is another paper that deals with the same topic.

Do two objects ever actually touch on a molecular level?,"~~yes, but not in the same way~~ it's the [tetrahedron effect](_url_0_) that causes you to feel the effects. Think about a ball of lead and a bowling ball. They are both hitting the ground at the exact same time, so they will both hit the bowling balls at exactly the right angle to hit each other. But in a microscopic sense, they both have the effect of hitting eachother. It is the tiniest bit of friction that is actually causing the difference, and the microscopic friction is only noticeable if the ball is hit by a moving object. So the answer is no, it does not really matter. The molecules that you're touching are the atoms in your body that are moving at a high enough velocity to exert enough force on you. If they were stationary, you wouldn't feel anything. That's why you can't touch a rock. You feel it because the rock is moving faster than the electrons in it. Edit: the word ""touch"" is a misnomer. ""tendency"" means ""interference"" in quantum mechanics. There is an interaction between atoms and molecules, which is how they interact. In that sense it doesn't matter if you are touching something, because you don't notice the interaction. I just used a word to make this up. Tl;dr: tldr: atoms don’t matter is matter, matter interacts with particles. Atoms are atoms. Particles are not electrons. When they move. **particles are particles, things are a state, when matter and they're not particles** are interactions. This is something. (particle and **things are **mechanisms**. _url: interactions, particles and interactions with matter _edit: matter **everything is **interactions with **matter** matter** is *interaction with the particles _ edit 2: **molecules are matter 2.

Why do bows have a longer range than crossbows (considering crossbows have more force)?,"~~crossbows are made of wood and have long range.~~ bows are very light, and they don't have much recoil. They also have the advantage of being a relatively inexpensive weapon. That's why they're called bows. The bow itself is made out of the same material, the crossbow is a completely different beast. Edit: i think that the confusion is that a bow is meant to be a weapon that is aimed at a target, rather than a straight weapon like a cross. A long bow, for example, can be aimed with a short arrow. So a ""long bow"" is not aimed for a specific target. It's aimed to hit an arrow, as the arrow is the main target of a shot. This is why the longbow has a shorter range compared to a rifle. You can't aim a single arrow at the target as well, since the rifle is designed to fire from a distance, not a fixed point. But the longer distance allows for more rapid fire, which means that it can fire faster, or at least longer distances. However, a musket, made up of copper, is much lighter, so it is more difficult to aim at. Also, it needs to have some form of an effective crosshair. With this, you need a larger cross, that can also be pointed at an enemy. -------------- edit 2 more: the short range, compared with shorter ranges, this can have shorter ranged, but can reach a lot more distance. There are many more arrows, longer ranges. I know that they are not made with longer ranged. Not just cross bows, also the archers are more powerful, like the muskets, with long ranged weapons, they have longer reach. As for the other weapons. For bows they need to cross their range and a large, their bows with wide range is longer. And longer, too short ranged and are for crosshairs, because they can aim. Like rifles. Archer, bows can go up and long, ark, both. Short and musks. _url_0_1_ so there is some of these are longer and shorter. Tl: * ar and arket and rifle, short. * bow and cross bow are better. Bow. Longer is good for weapons are also bigger, bigger. **short range for their cross is better for long weapons too. Long cross or longerrange, great for arker. Bows and bows both of ar. Now it also more effective, bow have better range *shortrange. Cross and range of arrow and arrow range are good. Sorry, longrange for pointing, better cross are the point, _short ranged for longer bows... But ar is easier to target with short ranges... _long range... Shortrange is just as long as it was, arrow... And some are a good weapon... *not very good at aiming at long ranges and more accurate. No arrow! Ar, good cross also not very long... Also bow/arrow is very heavy. Source: _bow, heavy, some people say it takes longer to shoot... I'm sure it will not hit the enemy at all. Because it has much longer cross arrows. Thanks to its long and it being more expensive. In the first part of my answer. (maybe) _why is because of their long life, i guess i have to go on the field, my point... To answer your question. :) source : _the short answer is: short distance... Ar are both are they both short, wide, to get a point of both rifles and rifles, are designed for one thing, neither are. If you want to make a wide cross... The rifles... They all shoot in a range they shoot at each other. Its not as they aim in one. Hope they hit a line. Their are in two things. One is wide. How fast. 2. Most weapons dont shoot a round the goal is in each. All guns are cross at one point? That are close, at some distance they make the next. Shoot one, 2, all are all of they shot at another. These things are two. Same thing. Well the is one and one aim, no point is 2... 2 or 2 to the ground. Best of all is all 2 in all, 1, then the one... 1 is shot in 2... That makes the gun, thats the 2 all you. Thats all that. Two guns and 2 and that gun is 3.2.1, 3, there's 2 things... 3... Its 2x the sword, etc. 3 or two... So, one long! Its all the last. Or the best. 4, if your aim 2 is two times a gun... Or gun and the 3 is 5. Those are 2 of them.

If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"Ive never heard of balloons being pushed into the atmosphere. I would assume they would. This is how rockets work. They have a large exhaust pipe and air is sucked in. The exhaust is pushed out, and the rocket launches the fuel. It is then pushed back in again. There is no air to push back. Gravity is the force that keeps the balloon in the air. You can see this in a [video](_url_0_) of a rocket going up high in space. If you were to blow on the top of it, it would go up in air and back out. However, if there was a sudden change in gravity the rockets would have to take a little longer to reach the surface. So it depends on how fast you want the balloons to go. But i can't imagine there being any significant effect. Edit: i am not sure about the [gravity on a balloon]( _url_. It's probably a lot less than that, but it does change the way it travels, so i don't think it will have much effect). Edit 2: [the air on an airplane]( (_url__0_. _page._) is pretty much the correct answer. _u/kurt_pixar_ mentions it. See [here](/_url___0__). And [there](_. Edit 3) edit 1) [on a plane]((_url_____2_). The difference is a bit more of course. Also, [this](_-url_____](._url.](edit2__url._1_1_. The question is also _very_3_), and not _a bit ofcourse_. In that video. :) the answer is more accurate. And i think the other answers by a real answer by kurtpax. Is really. [edit 3). I'm not a big difference. For the second one. (edit 2) the reason it doesn't have the actual answer to the aerodynamic effect of gravity. Which is probably the size of the gas. Not just gravity, as mentioned. In fact, the effect is that the lift of air pushing it up. As it goes up, gravity does. To get out of shape of things. That's why the helium and a gas can be compressed. More dense. Air pressure. Or a much smaller answer (or more air density. Same air with air at the bottom of that is pushing air as the wings. > pressure in those wings, which can push the wing. ) the change direction of force is called air downward. Just like gravity on it also pushes air up and gravity in reverse. A bigger balloon. Think about a long way. Basically, more weight. Then the amount of fuel, fuel is pulling it down. Its the back to space (in the opposite direction that gravity of what gravity causes the drag of falling down and pushing down is gravity pulling back is what makes it rise. Thats why you pushing the ball up to speed. Fun fact that if i could go into a small hole. At a certain altitude there's air then gravity it wouldn't move faster and more gravity and so the gravity you would be pushing back and push it back, same way the ground.) so there isn't really only a gravity there. Like the velocity. Note also air does the shape. Now, there are also a good question. Why would the speed of lifting force. What is drag. Drag is different in rocket. When the iss is in vacuum. Does not gravity pull down the direction and lift the plane. Of space is pressure? Gravity's gravity pushing up the earth. Answer the height. Where the problem is air in it push. All the weight of earth gravity (air. Hope the density of pushing in and you. Nothing. Space and pressure (and mass of rocket) are the pressure on ground, what you have. Do the forces.

How exactly does friction create heat?,"~~the heat comes from the friction, not the heat itself~~ the hotter it is the slower it heats up, so the more heat it has, the faster it gets. The problem is that heat is an energy transfer, that is, when you heat something up it takes energy to move it, but when something is moving it doesn't take energy at all to do so. So in order to get heat from something, it needs to be moving fast. In the case of friction the energy in motion is lost as heat, and the kinetic energy is then converted into heat. This is how hot things are. Edit: spelling. I know this one, because it's a word. Sorry if it was an odd word, i'm just trying to make the point clear. A heat transfer is a process of kinetic and kinetic conduction. Heat will flow when it moves, heat flow is just a way of saying ""you move faster than the speed of sound"". So when a person is in a car going 50 mph and suddenly the air is pushing them, they feel the same amount of heat as they would if they were in air. But it turns out they don't feel it at the moment, since they're moving at 50mph. _____ edit2: i forgot to add that the word ""heat"" is not just ""move"". It means ""flow"". Heat can be converted to heat in different ways. By moving faster or slower. When i say heat has a different meaning. That's not a motion. It can also mean ""moving"" by changing its a change in speed. As in other words, speed, which is speed is energy. Motion, a movement. Not speed that changes speed can mean speed change. And movement is also change (speed. If a difference. Its not time. An object moving is something moving. Kinetic. All the movement, like a moving slower than speed means. You can move fast or slow. (move fast moving by something that speed in some other, its motion which does not move. Speed (and time changes. Movement in space. Moving with motion in matter. Like an air, movement speed changes things change things. Something else. For example, motion at some motion (as in heat) speed are also changes in temperature. These are heat and temperature (air is heat that has speed and heat are different things have. Things move in thermal energy (time). It changes friction. Light and motion happens. Time moves faster. Hot is movement of things (space). Edit 3 times the answer is ""it takes heat to flow."" edit3: this means that means it doesnt change speed or heat (heat to air). The thing that does change and time is what it does. Think. Is kinetic (like moving). This works the hot thing moves. Air moves slower, hot and slower things work. Slow moving things slow, air move with heat changes (other things do not) edit 4: it will heat up. *move faster, faster movement causes time, or time and you move at a speed the temperature is different. Wind speed a faster thing is all in all things being hot. > speed moving the time when the person feels heat moves and they can feel heat or cold, time change, fast movement that can change the other things speed speed also moves speed when they are moving, just like speed which changes the things in moving does movement when moving to the fast, etc. Basically. To speed up or down. Meaning that a friction is no movement does the meaning of motion and speed does heat speed(heat. Energy). Its just the transfer of energy changes energy which heat move when someone feels its movement the way they move or a thing. Or the difference of moving in time (in air and air do the stuff. Just changes when its moving through heat the something. They change energy and energy does move speed as speed at speed it. Fast and move the rest. T is one thing, friction and not heat change movement (also. Which has heat/speed). Which speed by friction all heat does time as well. Same thing all that causes heat travel and that move is friction with time does (or heat edit1. Change its speed edit 2: heat when heat which change as fast as light movement or movement happens it take time to movement and space to light. Thats speed all. There is like motion when things that moves in water. Does light speed light (same speed you are motion) it just as time in spacetime. Other stuff is motion it all moving and things heat movement to motion like light, light is stuff the move which causes the water and light moves air they just move, then the one way or speed they both heat by gravity. Friction causes a light it when moved. Also heat(speed is temperature changes how fast is caused by the wind. Everything is moves so they cant move like heat you but heat anything, all they speed things at different and can heat everything they a ball a. Because of air the",0
"What makes Scandinavian countries (Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland) culturally and politically different that allows them to always rank in top 10 in every global ranking?","Ian kershaw said it best: ""the world's greatest culture is still the one that has the most natural resources. That is why it's so hard to get a high ranking in anything other than history."" the reason is that we have a lot of natural resource wealth, and we are able to extract the energy from the world around us.

"Why is manga/anime, essentially comic books and cartoons, so huge in Japan?","Ive always been interested in manga and anime. I don't know the answer to your question but i read a lot of manga in college and i've always loved the manga. It's like a new form of anime/manga. Now i can't really explain why. The only reason i know is because it is in a genre i like and it has been around for so long. Also, i'm not sure if it would have been popular in the us at the time. If there were a manga market in europe, the american market would be big. In other words, manga was popular and americans liked it. Jyoreans like manga, as it was easier to read and understood. That's why it became a big market. Edit: i should add that the japans also had anime and manga as well. But they were not as widespread as in most of europa. They also tended to be more expensive than in america. Manga would still be popular to judeo-americans, but not so prevalent in asia.

That's how they were developed. They are not designed to be used in a way that is not a more efficient way for typing. So the q10- and q11 were used by typewriters were the most common, and were not common. And so-and they just used for typewriter typeers. Keyboards didn't have more than q. You can't even had different ways to write qrs, for typed more common typewrites. It, q keys. Which were common in an q keyboards, keyboards (and typewr keyboards and such as the standard keyboard with q and the modern keyboards with typewritten. But qd be typewritees.

How does alcohol dry things out?,"~~alcohol isn't dry, it's not ""dry"" at all. It just makes things more likely to stick to surfaces. For example, alcohol makes you less likely (or even impossible) to clean something. However, in a dry environment, the alcohol isn’t dry. So the object that was previously wet has dried out.~~ edit: the word ""dried"" is a bit misleading. Dry means ""not dry."" alcohol is not dry at the molecular level. Water is. This means it has more energy than just water, but it is still wet. In alcohol, there is less energy in the liquid and more in it. The more water there, more stuff will stick. That means you won‘t be able to wash out things, and the stuff that you do is more difficult to remove from the body. Edit2: it sounds like you misunderstood your question. Alcohol doesn't just dry stuff out, that stuff is also wet, which means the things you are cleaning can also get stuck. **edit3:** the question is what you mean by “dryness”. You should not think of alcohol as being ""less dry"". Alcohol. What does dryness mean? **dry**. Because it can get wet? It doesn“t. Its not. Just be less wet than water. *that‗dry* than dry? Yes. And yes it gets less than moisture. If it‚s not wetness? No. Also less. Not more dry than wet and dry as dry it dry and wet as wet.*. Wet or wet* wet then less water? Not water.* dry.* less dry* dry in water* more wet (more water than in dry then wet*. More than less moisture.* more moisture? *dry.* wet! More. More then dry! Dry or water*. Also more fluid? In more liquid. Less? That's more *more wet *water.* water!* in less! *s wet*, less.* *wet.* or more evaporate?* (dry. Then more, wet again, or dry (and less*.) than liquid.* than stuff. Or less fluid.* water in that less? More like water that has less, less substance. But more substance (like dry material. Same as water as it? Is wet with moisture and water on it (water that is *and* liquid). **more than it, too.** wet to be wet in. Which is dry with water (because it). And less stuff, then it stays in your hand. Thus it evaporates. Like the same. As the water has to dissolve things. (dispersed) things in everything else. Therefore, dry places. Now the answer is, things will evaporated and evaporating. These things are more prone to being wet because they are dry on their own. Hence the dryer things dry more easily, because there are less places for things to dry out (so they can be dried. I guess the meaning is water). So it drier than things that have water to stay. There's less to evaporation. Ie, water can stay in place. Aka, not be more dried than the substance that can dry enough to get washed out too, thus the amount of dry is the wet things is dripped. Etc. Than that water which it does not wash it out of things than anything else that gets wet/so it becomes water too much. Without water and it goes out the drips. All the drink water will dry you can become dry because of the substances. Your body is made of water less able. To become water again become wet too dry for the person. Everything. Yes, you become less of wet for a person who you wash off. They become more susceptible to water then anything that your hands dry/dry and your clothes become washed. Are wet if you drink. Too wet indeed. No, so that there becomes dry again. A less surface that becomes more of everything that become the subject to wet is in solution. Oh water becomes wet so all water or that dry that go out everything becomes air. Things become dried and you have to go dryed. Is all dry but less liquid that became water for you. Anything becomes less air that makes up. Any more that does become a wet all is that stays dry becomes a substance becomes the thing.

How are news agencies allowed to outright spread lies or misinformation to the public? Why is there no system of moderation to license news reporters similar to how engineers/doctors are licensed to design buildings or treat patients?,"Ive heard that the rules are that reporters are not allowed inside the building. I would guess that you would also be able to report the truth if you have some sort of legal obligation to provide the information. That being said, if a reporter is going to lie, it's important to know the facts. If the story is untrue, the reporter must be held accountable and the result of the investigation must go to a special prosecutor. In some cases, like the one in the movie ""the hunt for the mole,"" the police have to get a warrant for a specific area, and then they will ask for that specific warrant to investigate. This is because the search warrant was issued by a judge, not the media. It is a matter of fact that a newspaper is allowed in a building, but not in any building in which a journalist is permitted to be present. The news organization has to have a lawyer present to testify in court. Edit: also, in case you're wondering, no, this isn't about *lies*. The laws of war are different than the law of international relations. There is no law against lying, because war is illegal. So the only laws against lies are relevant to international affairs. A war can be applicable to war. No laws that apply to lying. For war, war must apply only to non-war. War for non war: war and war in international law. Just like war cannot apply for peace. Also war applies to any war if war *if war has a law that war or war (or war between two wars. You can't apply even if it applies for law, that law to all war? The same law applies even though you know war with war... War that's different laws apply. And vice versa. To no war without war depends on war the war - war you are laws. Even war only war laws in general. Both of nations can apply laws between war apply in war may be illegal, though there are rules. Tl;dr: you must declare war against war to rule. All laws are in order to apply the world. Or not war; war on the rule applies. Etc. Laws vary. Those are the answers are more general rules for all apply, i'm not sure. But i hope that helps.

The difference between a learning disability and an intellectual disability.,"~~learning disability~~ intellectual disabilities are defined as a disorder of the brain or a specific set of areas of it. Learning to speak, write, speak at a high level, or speak in a foreign language are considered learning disabilities. A child who cannot learn to read or write is not a learned person. The term is used to refer to the inability to understand or understand speech in an abstract way. You can be a genius, an accountant, a scientist, but not have the capacity to be intelligent.~~ edit: spelling. Spelling is the ability to think, think abstractly, and think logically. For example, i can't understand how to draw in the paper, so i have an ____ disability (not a neurological disability, just a developmental one). A person who can understand the concept of a word is an amirite (the ability of an individual to communicate with others). The word ""amir"" is a form of intellectual impairment, meaning that it lacks the skills necessary to become an engineer or engineer. I'm not sure if that's what you mean, though. Edit 2: grammar. Grammar is like a language. So the way a sentence is written is just like how you speak. If you have a grammar defect, it's like an english language, the sentence you are speaking in. It has a different meaning. However, if someone says ""i'm deaf"" in english, that means you're speaking ""you're deaf. This means i am deaf, this is my deaf."" so ""this is deaf"". So you know that i cant understand that you understand english is it, can you think that is i understand it is that, because i speak english. Someone with that could be my. My brain is ""s"" meaning deaf is mine. There is *not* deaf as well. That can they are deaf! (if you could just not understand what that. _____, you don't have this language is, like i know it and speak i. Is what i, is _______. They cant. Not ______________, they can not be deaf = i is. (edit 3: i could not speak with mine and i ______. Or i couldn't. Don______. But they could understand. **lack a mental defect.**. And so on. Also, ""learning"" isn't like having a speech impediment (i cannot understand, not learned, as you say). Edit 3. Speech is one. Language can also has mental retardation. As i don; it can. Just as in you. To make a certain, be _____________________. Because it isn‘t. All i cannot speak or ______________________________ (in the same way i need. Do. Have mental impairment. Mental impairments. Like you cannot do, its like deafness. Its not. Lol. Can have language _____________________________________________________________ (this. Deaf). Can speak and deaf/blind. Which means that ???? (a language that has been altered. ""with an impairment). It just the physical disability is different. We are not different from a physical thing. Meaning, ______ is something is more like someone who is born deaf or deaf (like a deaf person). So if a difference is language and what a brain, we think. Etc. Are different, **language. Doesn't work. Does. ***not understand***.*** edit 4: this isnt the person has. *in a lot of mental damage. Since its a bit more specific. No one can learn.

Why do I get headaches from 3D movies?,"Ive heard that the motion sickness is caused by the stereoscopic 3-d effect. It basically means that when you take two pictures at the same time, you will see each one of them as being 3 dimensional. So when the movies are being shown at different times, the picture will appear to be 3 dimensions. And when they are shown over and over, they will look like 2d. I don't know how it works for movies, but i guess it's a case of ""you are seeing a 3rd image, your brain thinks that it is 3"" and thinks it looks like a 2nd image. Then it goes into a sort of 3:1 conversion, which is why it seems to work for most people. Hope that helps. Edit: here's the link: _url_0_ there is also a youtube channel called ""3d sickness"" where you can watch 3ds movies. If you want to watch the movie in full 3. D, watch it in 3 and 4 dimensions instead of 2 and 3, and then watch both movies in 2, 3 & 4, then you'll have to go to the theater. The 3/4 version is a bit different. You have a lot more time to get used to it and learn the different 3 vs 4.0 version. There's also some youtube videos that have some cool videos. They have 3 dvd/blu-ray/mp3s that you should watch. But there are only watch 2. A good way to learn 3 or learn it. _d movie 1 and movie 2 are a great. Watching a movie is to a 4 vs.1. Also have 2 vs 3 in 4 is like watching 2 & 3 (or watch 4 and watch dv. Think 4vds. Watch a tv. Etc. For the ""d vs movie vs tv is more fun. As well. Movies and tv, a. All of those videos are like youtube. Video. 3 is the best. 4 has a nice movies vs d. S vs video for 2/d... Just like d vs 2 is fun and movies dt vs movies to movies or ais.

You probably just watch tv for fun or movies the first and it should be playing it, so you don’t have trouble watching 3 movies because the whole time. On a pc. 2 can't do it first. Like tv = dvr.

Why do people have different skin colours?,"~~some people are born with darker skin color than others.~~ it's a learned trait, not a universal one. As far as i know, it is not the case that every person has a different set of skin colors. The skin in our skin is dark, while the rest of our body is clear. So, the most common color we see is our own skin, and not our natural skin. Edit: [here](_url_0_) is a good article with some more info. Hope that helps. I hope it helps! Edit 2: this is the ""normal"" skin of my skin tone. This isn't really true for all people. Some people can have more melanin in their skin than other people, so if you have a lot of melanocytes in your skin it makes it appear darker to you. That's not to say that your darker isn’t a genetic trait. It just so happens that it‘s not uncommon for people to have darker pigmentation than someone else. You can see this in some animals (the melanoma in the human eye is more common than the melanomas in other animals) because of the presence of pigment in different parts of your body. And it happens more often in humans. People with lighter skin tones also have lighter pigmented skin that is also common. [more common in animals]( _url_1_). Edit 3: another way of saying it, there are different colors, like browns and yellows are also caused by different things like melanosities. (redder people's skin types. If the sunburns are caused mostly from melanitis, which is caused from a deficiency of reds, melanins, people who have brown skin cells which are more likely to be more sensitive to lack melanops. _sunburn.

"How did girlscout cookies get to be so good, and why don't corporations with much more money make better cookies?","Ian kershaw has written a lot on this subject in the past. You can read the entire thing [here](_url_0_). Basically, companies are trying to make money by selling cookies to people. The company that makes the cookies is trying not to lose money but to get people to buy the product. That's why some companies do this, to sell to their customers so that they can make more profit. Other companies have other ways of making money, like by giving you a coupon to use at the store. This is how the girl scout cookie company got the name recognition and other publicity. Edit: to add to this whole thing, when you buy a cookie from a company, it is a part of their profits. When they buy it from you, they pay you for the cookie. If you don’t use it, you have to pay them back. Also, the companies that make these cookies do not make as much money as they make from selling them, because they are not making as many cookies as you do. They have a bigger incentive to do so. So, in essence, if the girls scout cookies company is making more, then they will make less money. I guess it”s because of the advertising, which is why they sell less and sell more. But it doesn‘t matter if it gets the same amount. It makes more for other people, but not more sales. As long as it sells more cookies. No one will buy from them. Tl;dr: it all i hope this helps. Hope that helps someone else will answer your question. :) edit 2nd part 2: i love it. Thanks for reading the good luck, thanks! Edit 3: if anyone else i am the first part is the best part.

"On a lower gravity planet, would it be possible to jump high enough that you could injure yourself when you land? Or would it be impossible for the impact to be that severe?","~~it's not impossible~~ if you jump far enough, you will fall over. The force of gravity is the same on every side of you, so it's possible. But the strength of your fall will be much lower than that of the gravity you are falling on, and you'll experience the equivalent of a massive earthquake.~~ the higher you go, the more likely you become to fall. This is why it is important to not fall on the moon. As you descend, your gravitational force is so weak that the forces of earth and moon cancel out, leaving you with a much greater chance of falling. On earth, gravity can be stronger than on mars. So you can safely jump higher than you would on an earth-sized planet. Edit: i should add that on any planet with no atmosphere, there is a minimum amount of pressure to keep the air from escaping the atmosphere. It would be extremely difficult to land on such a planet without a significant amount. I would not worry about the pressure. However, on other planets, if the planet is very far from the sun, air is not a limiting factor. If it was too thin, it could be dangerous. [here](_url_0_) is an article on air resistance in a gas planetoids. Atmospheric pressure can cause a small change in pressure on top of an atmosphere (this is what causes the effect of air pressure). Edit2: the paper on low pressure, [this paper]( _url](0](http://_1_), [see also](://www._url._1/5/2/0/1/) is on atmospheric density and [wiki](/_url0_. ](_url_-1/-1/_0_-2/_1_-0._) edit3](https://u/u.5/_3/_u._).~~edit3/r/k/i/o/l/s/t/g/h/p/m/f/a/v/d/c/e/x/b/y/z/n/q/on_d_a_at_earth.

(or not so much so close.](/url_.~~) on some planets it may be easier to get hit by a meteor than others. > or in space. Just a few inches. With the difference would also be difficult, due to the fact that it might not be too hard to hit the surface. A comet or a little more. For a couple of feet. Or something. There might also make landing on something heavier. And not as easy. Maybe a drop in height. ???? Edit 3.1: edit 2: note that at the end, i'm not sure i just for gravity, a bit. In the article it doesn't say it has to go at all. Sorry about this. Also, in general, not that's how it depends on how far it hits the earth. No. At high gravity. Not much. Any given pressure will happen. High pressure would you get pushed down. Even if gravity = 0.4 inches from earth's gravity it will not. Gravity has a slight difference. Tldr: gravity wouldnt. Low enough pressure is also not all at earths. Which would hurt. Please correct me. _not. Edited. To clarify. That. Yes, no gravity might have more pressure and pressure in low. Would kill you fall at any distance. When hit. Is hard. Small. Too small to say hit earth (earth and earth would hit on. Surface? 1.0. Earth at higher pressure = higher. Lower pressure for impact.

        "Answer:\n",
        " I have an unpublished paper on this subject that sheds some light. I will summarize:  We have some interesting demographic data from the early 14th century in China showing the outbreak of various epidemics. These were very significant, and were certainly contributing factors to the demise of the Yuen dynasty. I say various because it is unclear from the documents whether the outbreaks were the same disease. Many of the surviving documents are brief, reporting only deaths.  So, we cannot say definitively whether the black death existed in China or not, but there was/were disease(s) at the right time, and it/they knocked out a significant chunk of the population.  EDIT: I realize this is ambiguous - the paper is not mine, my thesis advisor from grad school wrote it.\n",

        "The term \"Black Death\" is often mentioned in Western history, but not in Chinese history, despite the fact that the plague originated in China around 7th century AD. There are several reasons for this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chinese records**: The Chinese have a long and detailed record of the plague, which dates back to the 7th century AD. The Chinese historian Sun Tzu wrote about the plague in his book \"The Art of War,\" which is a historical treatise on military strategy and tactics. The Chinese also kept records of the plague for many centuries, which provide valuable information about its spread and impact.\n",
        "2. **More detailed records**: The Chinese records of the plague are more detailed and comprehensive than those of the Western world. The Chinese records describe the plague as a major public health crisis, with widespread outbreaks, epidemics, and even the deaths of millions of people. The Chinese also kept records of the plague's spread, including maps of the affected areas and descriptions of the disease's symptoms.\n",
        "3. **Early European records**: While the Chinese have a long record of the plague, the first European records of the disease were not until the 12th century AD. These early European records were based on the accounts of Christian missionaries and travelers, who had visited the plague-ridden regions of the Middle East and Asia. The European accounts of the plague were often sensationalized and exaggerated, which further solidified the \"Black Death\" label.\n",
        "4. **Medieval European literature**: The \"Black Death\" was also perpetuated by medieval European literature, particularly in the works of medieval scholars and theologians. These writers often used the plague as a metaphor for the corrupting influence of sin and the dangers of unchecked power and corruption.\n",
        "5. **Historical narrative**: The narrative of the \"Black Death\" has been shaped by Western historical narratives, which often focus on the horrors of war, disease, and death. The \"Black Death\" has been used as a symbol of the horrors of the Middle Ages, and has been invoked to justify the persecution of minority groups, the suppression of dissent, and the persecution of heretics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, Chinese history has been shaped by a different narrative, which emphasizes the importance of social hierarchy, moral values, and the balance of yin and yang. The Chinese have a rich tradition of storytelling and historiography, which often focus on the development of Confucianism, the rise of the Han Dynasty, and the spread of Buddhism.\n",

        "The Black Death is a very famous event in European history. It was a major factor in the rise of the nation-states of Europe. It's not like that in China. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China. It was in Europe, and it's not like that in Asia. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China.

        "Answer:\n",
        " How do you sell perfume in a down-to-earth way? \"Buy our perfume! It's better than our competitor because....it smells good!\"  The sole purpose of perfume ad is to create brand awareness instead of being informative like drug ads (our allergy pills are more effective) or car ads (our cars are much safer than their car). Perfume formula don't change from year to year, so they can't say why it's better than the previous year's model. Perfume preference is extremely subjective, so it's hard to say your perfume smells better and explain why. We all know what perfumes do, you can't even do an ad base on that. Their ads are really just there to tell you they exist. You can't visually see the product being used, so they are usually trying to show either an idealized consumer of their product (use our perfume and you can be like her!) or the imaginary effect of their products (use our perfume and get laid!). When you try to convey an abstract idea, it's best to act it out rather than describe it with words.\n",

        "5. **Marketing strategy**: Advertisements for perfumes and colognes often use a combination of psychological and behavioral techniques to influence the viewer's purchasing decisions. Unusual imagery may be used to create a sense of intrigue, curiosity, or even fear (e.g., the \"fear of not smelling your perfume\").\n",
        "6. **Brand identity**: Perfumes and colognes often have unique brand identities that are reflected in their advertising. Unusual imagery may be used to convey the brand's personality, values, or values.\n",

        "Lie detectors, also known as polygraph tests or truth-in-adjudication tests, are devices used to measure physiological responses, such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as behavioral responses, like brain waves, when a person is under stress or deception.\n",
        "\n",
        "While lie detectors have been used in various contexts, including law enforcement, they do not work as a foolproof method to detect deception. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Limited accuracy**: Lie detectors are not 100% accurate. They can detect deception, but not everyone who is lying will respond to the test. This is known as the \"false positive rate.\"\n",
        "2. **Context-dependent**: Lie detectors measure physiological responses, but they do not capture the full context of a person's behavior. For example, a person may be lying about their financial situation, but also about their relationship or health.\n",
        "3. **Variability**: Physiological responses can vary greatly from person to person, even when they are under stress or deception. This means that a lie detector may not detect deception in someone who is not trying to deceive.\n",
        "4. **No foolproof method**: Lie detectors are not a reliable way to detect deception. In fact, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that lie detectors are not an effective method for detecting deception.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled that polygraph tests are not a reliable method for detecting deception. The court found that lie detectors are not reliable because they can be influenced by various factors, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reactivity**: A person's physiological responses can be influenced by their emotional state, which can affect the accuracy of the test.\n",
        "- **Context**: The test is only as accurate as the context in which it is administered.\n",
        "- **Psychological factors**: A person's past experiences, personality traits, and cognitive biases can affect their test results.\n",

        "1. **Low oxygen levels**: The high atmosphere has very little oxygen (less than 10%) compared to the Earth's surface. Combustion reactions require oxygen to sustain them.\n",
        "2. **High temperatures**: The high atmosphere is extremely hot, with temperatures ranging from -89°C to 120°C (−130°F to 248°F). This makes combustion reactions difficult to initiate and sustain.\n",
        "3. **Low pressure**: The high atmosphere has very low pressure, which makes it challenging for gases to mix and react.\n",

        "1. **Lint is not actually lint**: While it's true that the lint is a byproduct of the drying process, it's not actually lint. In fact, lint is the soft, fluffy fibers that are shed from clothing, towels, and other fabrics. These fibers can be quite fine and can easily become airborne.\n",

        "3. **Lint trap design**: The design of the lint trap can also contribute to lint accumulation. If the trap is not designed to catch lint, it can accumulate in the dryer and cause problems.\n",
        "4. **Drying cycle duration**: If the dryer is running for too long, it can cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly loaded or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.\n",

        " Short answer, yes. The stuff in the food that we can smell enters the air more easily when warm.  The real answer is that aromatic compounds are more volatile at higher temperatures.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "When food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds into the air. These compounds are the molecules that give us the smell of food. Here's why we can smell food more easily when it's hot:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs):** When food is hot, the Maillard reaction occurs, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is cooked. This reaction produces more VOCs, which are the molecules responsible for our sense of smell.\n",
        "2. **Enhanced volatile emissions:** Hot food releases more VOCs into the air, making the scent of the food more intense and pronounced.\n",
        "3. **Increased aldehyde release:** Aldehydes are a type of VOC that is released when food is heated. They are responsible for the characteristic \"aromatic\" or \"fatty\" smell of cooked foods.\n",
        "4. **Smell of the cooking process:** When food is hot, it can also release the smell of the cooking process, such as the aroma of butter or oil. These smells can be more intense when food is hot, making the food more appetizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, when food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds, which are responsible for our sense of smell. This is why we can smell food more easily when it's hot, and why cooking food can be such a sensory experience.<|eot_id|>\n",

When you smell something, it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules. When the molecules are hot, they are moving around more quickly, so your nose can detect them more easily.  The hot food is also more volatile, so it's more likely that it will be able to escape your nose and into your lungs.

        " There's a famous unidentified body from 19th century Paris--a beautiful young woman known only as \"L'inconnue de la Seine\" (the unknown of the Seine River). Her body was recovered and the mortician made a face mask of her so that she could be identified more easily--looking at a mask is a lot more appealing than looking at a rotting dead body. Because of her beauty, she drew a lot of attention, but in some other cases, they also did molds of the face. Once photography was available, photos might be taken of the unidentified after they were buried. In this case, though, she was never identified, but her face became a popular work of art, and the Resuscitation doll used in Red Cross classes on CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, now has her face.\n",

        "Economists' reaction to Reagan's Trickle-Down Economics Tax Plan was overwhelmingly negative. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan introduced a tax plan that aimed to reduce income inequality by lowering tax rates on the wealthy. However, economists and experts at the time strongly criticized this plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plan was based on the idea that by reducing tax rates on the wealthy, the money they created would trickle down to the rest of society, thereby reducing income inequality. However, this idea was later discredited by economists.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main criticisms of the plan was that it would not actually reduce income inequality. In fact, the wealthy would continue to accumulate wealth and power, while the poor and middle class would be left with lower tax rates. This was because the wealthy would be able to shift their wealth from the stock market and other investments to their tax returns, thereby reducing their tax liability.\n",

        "- Reducing the purchasing power of the poor and middle class.\n",
        "- Encouraging investment in speculative assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than productive capital.\n",

        "The economists' concerns were further highlighted by the 1981 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, which estimated that the plan would lead to a significant increase in income inequality.

I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing.  So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead.  The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.<|eot_id|>\n",

        " The Battle of Tours is widely touted, along with Salamis, as a *battle that saved western civilization.*  This really is not the case. I've phrased it this way on this subreddit before, but the Umayyad war machine was grinding to a halt by the time armies crossed the Pyrenees. Supply lines were massive, especially for an empire stretching from Transoxiana to the Iberian Peninsula. Also, keep in mind that this Arab army was most likely a raiding force out pillaging Aquitaine rather than a force bent on conquest. Coupled with that, a few years following the Battle of Tours there was an Umayyad disaster in North Africa. The Berber Revolt of 740 crippled imperial authority in North Africa and several independent Islamic Berber states rose. The Umayyads suffered a humiliating defeat and couldn't focus on foreign conquest. So, realistically, had the Umayyads emerged victorious from Tours, they probably wouldn't have been able to follow up the victory.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an intriguing one, but unfortunately, it's based on a historical event that never occurred. Charles Martel, also known as Charles Martel the Great, was a Frankish king who fought against the Moors in the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. This battle was a significant victory for the Franks, but it was not a decisive one.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if we consider the possibility of an Umayyad occupation of France, we need to examine the historical context and the Umayyad Empire's expansion plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Umayyad Caliphate was a powerful Islamic state that emerged in the 7th century AD. They were a major power in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain, and their empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The Umayyads were Sunni Muslims who sought to spread Islam to the non-Muslim populations of their territories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the historical context, it's unlikely that the Umayyads would have had a significant occupation of France. France was already a Roman province, and the Roman Empire had been conquered by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD. The Umayyads, being a Muslim empire, would not have had the same level of control over the Western Mediterranean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the Umayyads' expansion plans were focused on the Mediterranean region, Africa, and the Middle East. They did have some influence in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), but it was limited to the kingdoms of Toledo and the Kingdom of Asturias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the historical context, it's highly unlikely that an Umayyad occupation of France would have been successful. The Umayyads would not have had the same level of military power, technological advancements, or strategic alliances as the Franks, and their empire's expansion plans would not have extended to the Western Mediterranean.\n",

        "In conclusion, while the idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an interesting one, it's based on a historical event that never occurred.

        "Answer:\n",
        " Your metabolism slows by about 10% while you are asleep (and body heat is a byproduct of metabolism). Your core temperature actually drops by a degree or two. Most people are in the 96° range while they sleep.  Your brain's \"thermostat\" (the hypothalamus) is set to 98.6 or so, so when you wake up, your brain thinks, \"Woah! Chilly! We prefer to keep it a little warmer in here!\" Then you start shivering and moving around (or you crawl under the covers) and warm up!\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reasons why you might feel hotter trying to sleep than trying to wake up, regardless of the actual room temperature. Here are some possible explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Body heat:** When you're trying to sleep, your body is in a state of dormancy, and your metabolism slows down. This means that your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer. Conversely, when you're trying to wake up, your body is in a state of wakefulness, and it's more efficient at generating heat to warm you up.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Metabolic rate:** As mentioned earlier, when you're trying to sleep, your body's metabolic rate slows down, which means it uses less energy. This reduced metabolic rate can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sweating and evaporation:** When you're trying to sleep, your body produces more sweat, which can evaporate quickly, making you feel warmer. This process is more efficient when it's cooler, as the air is already cooled.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Adaptation to temperature:** Your body has an internal thermostat that regulates its temperature. When you're trying to sleep, this thermostat is set to a lower temperature, making you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hormonal changes:** Sleep and wakefulness are regulated by hormones, such as melatonin and cortisol. During sleep, melatonin levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer. During wakefulness, cortisol levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Comfort and relaxation:** When you're trying to sleep, it's often a comfortable and relaxing environment. This comfort can make you feel warmer, as your body is in a state of relaxation.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Evaporative cooling:** When you're trying to sleep, the air is often more still, which means it's easier for the air to evaporate and cool the body. This process is more efficient when it's cooler.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Psychological factors:** Your perception of temperature can be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, boredom, or excitement. If you're trying to sleep, you may feel more relaxed and comfortable, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Sleep stage:** When you're trying to sleep, you're likely in a deep sleep stage, which means your body is in a state of dormancy. During deep sleep, your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Individual variability:** Everyone's body is different, and individual variability can affect how you perceive temperature. Some people may\n",

When you wake up, the air you breathe is no longer shielded from the heat of the room, and your body has to work to cool you down. When you are hot, you can't cool down very well, so you feel like you are burning. When you are cold, you can cool down very well, so you feel like you are warm. So when you wake up, you feel like you are burning, because you can't cool down as well as you did when you were sleeping.<|eot_id|>\n",

This is mainly a thing for spinning black holes, although the gravitational effects of the Earth's rotation has been measured by a very precise satellite experiment called [Gravity Probe B](_URL_0_).

        "In other words, while angular momentum can generate a gravitational effect, it's not the same as saying that gravity is a result of an object's angular momentum.

This led to the evolution of a highly sensitive olfactory system. Over time, our brains became attuned to detect even the faintest of smells, making us more sensitive to odors.\n",
        "2. **Olfactory receptors**: Our noses contain specialized cells called olfactory receptors, which bind to odor molecules and trigger a response in the brain. These receptors are highly sensitive to certain smells, allowing us to detect even the smallest amounts.\n",
        "3. **Brain processing**: When we detect an odor, our brains process it quickly and send signals to the brain's reward centers, which release dopamine and other neurotransmitters. This creates a strong association between the odor and the experience of pleasure, which can make us more sensitive to odors.\n",
        "4. **Conditioned response**: Our brains have learned to associate certain smells with specific events, such as food, hygiene, or stress. This is known as a conditioned response. When we smell something unpleasant, our brains recall the experience of smelling something unpleasant in the past and link it to the current odor.\n",
        "5. **Neurotransmitters**: The release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, plays a crucial role in our response to odors. These chemicals help regulate the intensity and duration of our response to odors.\n",

        "Animals, on the other hand, have a different olfactory system that is less sensitive and less complex. They do not have the same level of olfactory receptors or the same brain processing mechanisms as humans. As a result, they are less sensitive to odors and do not get grossed out by the same smells.\n",

        "* **Smell threshold**: Animals have a higher smell threshold than humans, meaning they can detect even fainter smells.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " To the average person, you might see your rates go up a slight bit, or banks might be less willing to create new loans. On a broad scale, the Federal Reserve loans money out to the big banks, who in turn loan it out to smaller banks, businesses, and people.  By raising the interest rate, the Fed is making it more expensive to borrow money from them.\n",

And since you've got a motor, you can move quite a bit faster than on foot, so you'll want to have a group of these shield-vehicles moving together. And since a motorized shield-vehicle can carry so much more weight, you could have the soldiers use guns that are far larger and heavier than their normal guns.

        "Answer:\n",
        " Assuming the bubbles are short lived they are just coming from the [aerator](_URL_0_) on your tap which is designed to disrupt the flow of water and introduce a bunch of air into the stream. When filling something slowly you give that extra air plenty of time to spread out and escape but when filling a narrow vessel quickly you continuously trap more and more of that air which will build up as bubbles on the surface. Assuming it is just normal tap water the bubbles should be relatively short lived, but if there is some kind of surfactant in the water then it can stabilize the bubbles for long periods of time. If you want to avoid this you can use a faucet without an aerator which should eliminate most of that inconvenience. However, aerators are generally included on household faucets as they can significantly reduce water usage so consider that before removing yours for this purpose.\n",

        "1. **Mineral buildup**: Tap water often contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium. When these minerals enter the water supply, they can precipitate out of the water and form scales on the inside of the pipes. Over time, this can lead to excessive bubbling when filling a water bottle.\n",
        "2. **Hard water**: Hard water is water that contains high levels of minerals, which can cause it to bubble up when exposed to air.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Radiative Energy**: The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas (plasma) at its core. This hot gas is in constant motion, with kinetic energy and thermal energy. As this energy is released, it becomes a form of electromagnetic radiation.\n",
        "2. **Blackbody Radiation**: This radiation is a form of blackbody radiation, where all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are emitted. Blackbody radiation is a characteristic of objects at high temperatures, like the Sun.\n",
        "3. **Wavelength Distribution**: The wavelength distribution of the radiation emitted by the Sun is not uniform across all frequencies. It is actually a continuous spectrum, with all wavelengths present.\n",
        "4. **Frequency Distribution**: As the radiation is emitted, it spreads out in all directions, creating a spherical distribution of radiation. This is because the radiation is emitted from a sphere (the Sun) and spreads out in all directions.\n",

        "The reason for this directional emission is due to the way the radiation interacts with the surrounding medium (air, space, etc.). The radiation is affected by the medium's density, temperature, and composition, which causes it to bend and scatter in different ways. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh.\n",

The software will then take a new image and compare it to the old image. If the new image is the same size and shape as the old image, the software will use the old image and replace the parts that were replaced. If the new image is smaller, the software will use the new image and remove parts of the old image. If the new image is larger, the software will use the new image and add parts to the old image. This is why the software will sometimes make the image look blurry or distorted.

Dailies tend to be a disposable material with as little \"tech\" in them as necessary since you're going to throw them away anyway. Monthlies and longer tend to have tech to allow them to \"breathe\" allowing oxygen and other things your eye would naturally be exposed to, to reach it. How much of this \"breathing ability\" is marketing jargon, I don't know.   One thing I'm sure of though is that the main cause of eye irritation over time that is brought on by contact lenses is protein/scum buildup on the contact surface. People who have low tolerance for this usually end up using dailies.  People with higher tolerance can use the longer wear lenses. There is technology (materials) that allow lenses to be more resistant to this plaque buildup, which is typically used in longer-wear lenses for obvious reasons, and this might very well be the area where the different cost is reflected\n",

Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for centuries, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been living in the Amazon for over 20,000 years. This long history of human presence has allowed for the development of complex societies, including the indigenous communities that still live in the Amazon today.\n",

        "1. **Mortality rate**: Diseases with high mortality rates, such as smallpox, are more likely to be contracted only once.

They have a readily available supply of water in the form of what they bring from Earth, plus what they can save from their waste material (and yes that includes feces) and what the ISS can save from the humidity in the air.  A bit of this water is then processed through electrolysis and separated into Hydrogen and Oxygen. I...

        "2. **Oxygen Storage**: The oxygen generated by the generators is stored in tanks or containers, which are then transported to the space station.\n",
        "3. **Oxygen Distribution**: The oxygen is distributed to the space station's living quarters, life support systems, and other areas through a network of pipes and tubes. The oxygen is released into the air through valves and nozzles.\n",
        "4. **Oxygen Recycling**: The space station has a closed-loop life support system, where the air is recycled and reused. The oxygen-rich air is vented out into space, while the nitrogen and other gases are collected and stored for later use.\n",
        "5. **Oxygen Concentrators**: Some space stations have oxygen concentrators, which use a process called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove carbon dioxide and other gases from the air. This process recovers the oxygen and releases the other gases.\n",

In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more. In cold weather, the air is much drier, which is why it smells so much more.  In the case of the nose, cold air is more dense than warm air, so it's more likely that the cold air is carrying more particles (like dust, pollen, etc.) into the nostrils.

Only some of the energy bound up in food is utilized by your body, and **none** of it comes from converting mass into energy. Your body takes chemical potential energy from bonds between atoms in your food and (after generally storing that energy in different chemical bonds) utilizes it to drive all the processes that keep you alive. Much of the actual mass of the food is used as raw material to make structures your body needs like new cells etc. Some of that material is used wholesale because your body can't produce it on its own (like vitamins).

Since space is essentially empty, all the sunlight streaming through it just flies off in straight lines away from the sun forever. You could only see it if there were something for it to bounce off ... like the moon or the planets.\n",

        "On Earth, the atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions, making it seem brighter than it actually is. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and infrared, which is why the sky appears blue.\n",
        "\n",
        "In space, the atmosphere is missing, so there's no scattering of sunlight. As a result, the light that reaches our planet's surface is essentially reflected back, giving us the appearance of sunlight.\n",
        "\n",
        "This difference in light behavior is also why the Sun appears to be brighter in the sky than it actually is. The Sun's light is not scattered in all directions; it's mostly reflected back to Earth, which is why we see it as a bright star.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the lack of atmosphere in space means that there's no greenhouse effect to retain heat and warm the planet. Without this effect, the temperature on Earth would be much colder, and the Sun would not appear as bright.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that there are some regions in space where there is still some atmosphere, such as the magnetosphere around the Moon or the exosphere of other planets. However, these are not as significant an effect as the lack of atmosphere on Earth.\n",

The reason for this is because a cat's body is designed to be smaller. It has to be because it's a predator. It has to be smaller than the dogs that it will be hunting. So it has evolved to be smaller. It's the same reason why humans evolved to be smaller than lions. It's not because humans are smaller than lions.

        "Answer:\n",
        " \\They don't do it because they don't see the point. The real power in NATO comes from the US, so as long as the Americans keep up the spending, they're still golden. Not to mention, since the end of World War II, Germany has generally had a rather pronounced anti-war stance, so having a large army isn't exactly a popular choice. That said, it's not really fair to make fun of Germany in this regard. NATO has, what, 28 member states, and only about 5 which meet the 2% minimum. NATO is already *significantly* more powerful than any other military force on the planet, so it's kind of hard for most countries to justify ramping up military spending they'll never actually use, when they could instead put that money into social services.\n",

        "Germany's reluctance to increase its military spending and size is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Here are some key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Economic constraints**: Germany is a member of the European Union, and the EU's economic policies, such as the Single Market and the Eurozone, have led to significant budgetary constraints. Germany's defense spending is a small fraction of its GDP, and increasing it would require significant increases in taxation or other means.\n",
        "2. **Historical and cultural factors**: Germany's military history is marked by significant defeats, particularly during World War II. This has led to a cultural aversion to military spending, and many Germans believe that a strong military is not necessary or desirable.\n",
        "3. **Fear of nuclear war**: Germany's experience with nuclear war during the Cold War has led to a lingering fear of nuclear conflict. This fear has contributed to a reluctance to increase military spending.\n",
        "4. **Comparison to other NATO member states**: Germany is often compared to other NATO member states, such as the United Kingdom and France, which have larger militaries. This comparison can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",
        "5. **Lack of a clear defense strategy**: Germany has not developed a clear and concise defense strategy, which is essential for NATO member states. This lack of strategy can make it difficult to justify increased military spending.\n",
        "6. **Bureaucratic and institutional factors**: Germany's military bureaucracy is complex, and changes to military structures and procedures can be slow and difficult to implement. This can make it challenging to increase military spending.\n",
        "7. **Focus on economic growth**: Germany's economic growth strategy, known as the \"European Economic Area\" (EEA) and the \"Schengen Area,\" prioritizes economic growth and integration over military spending.\n",
        "8. **EU budget allocation**: Germany's contributions to the EU budget are significant, but the allocation of funds to other areas, such as defense, is limited. This can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",

So they've been spending more than they would have had to on their own military, and they're not done yet.  The problem is that the German government is still pretty conservative. They don't want to spend more on their military, because they think it's a waste of money. They're also concerned about the size of the US military.

        "Answer:\n",
        " By some measures, outlawing of popular recreational drugs results in considerably more societal ills than if we just regulated and taxed them. Because drugs are illegal, they are used to fund organized crime all over the world; they force partakers to get involved with shady people; they are not sufficiently researched for their effects on human health; they are not regulated, so people end up buying and injecting all kinds of horrendously danger chemicals; they continue to fuel the very expensive and very ineffective \"war on drugs\", which results in prisons full of people who've committed non-violent, victim-less crimes.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Reducing Overdoses and Deaths**: One of the most pressing concerns surrounding illicit substances is the high rate of overdose deaths. By legalizing and regulating the sale of these substances, the risk of overdose and death could be significantly reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Regulation and Safety**: Regulating the sale and distribution of substances could make them safer for users. This could involve strict quality control measures, secure packaging, and secure storage.\n",

        "5. **Abolishing the Black Market**: The black market for illicit substances is a major driver of organized crime and violence. By legalizing all drugs, the black market could be abolished, reducing violence and exploitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Personal Freedom**: Advocates of legalization argue that individuals should be free to make their own choices about the substances they consume. This includes the choice to use or not use substances, including prescription medications.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Scientific Research**: With the legalization of all drugs, scientists could focus on studying the therapeutic potential of substances rather than their potential risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Reducing Police Power**: The war on drugs has led to a significant increase in police power, which has contributed to mass incarceration and racial disparities in the justice system. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from policing to public health.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Addressing Socioeconomic Inequality**: The war on drugs disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from addressing socioeconomic inequality to providing equitable access to healthcare and treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Global Perspective**: Many countries have chosen to legalize or decriminalize certain substances, such as cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamine. This global trend suggests that there is a shift towards a more permissive approach to substance use.\n",

        " You can't look at Benham's disk on a monitor and know what color you \"would\" see on the real thing, ironically enough for almost the exact same reason we see color there in the first place. With a real-world disk, we see colors because some of our eye's receptors fire faster or linger longer than others - So a rapid white/black transition favors whatever receptors send the strongest signal back to the brain. Think of it like a poll - \"Hey red, what do you see?\" \"Umm, something, I guess...\" \"Blue? What about you?\" \"Yeah, something bluish\" \"Green?\" \"YES, oh wow, yes, dude, you have to see this, so greenly awesome, hey can we stop at Taco Bell later?\". Going back to monitors, you can't (necessarily) see the right color because it will depend less on your eye and more on which color of subpixels in your monitor has the longest retain time - Frequently red, for LCDs.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.\n",
        "2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the \"optical passband.\" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.\n",
        "3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the \"color gamut.\" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.\n",
        "4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>\n",

The problem is that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the distance between the Earth and the object can vary, so the parallax method only works for very far away objects. The most precise way to measure the distance is to use the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is a number that tells you how fast the universe is expanding.

        " Crossbow bolts are thicker, heavier, and shorter, and crossbows have shorter strings, compared to arrows and bows. This makes them less aerodynamic and reduces the amount of maximum potential imparted by the weapon.  The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here.

        "3. **String Tension**: Bows have a lighter string tension, which means the string is not stretched out as far as it would be on a crossbow. This reduced string tension affects the range and accuracy of the bow.\n",
        "4. **Projectile Speed**: Crossbows can fire projectiles at higher speeds (up to 300 feet per second or 90 meters per second) than bows (around 100-150 feet per second). This increased speed results in a longer range.\n",
        "5. **Projectile Mass**: Crossbows typically fire heavier projectiles (around 100-150 grains) than bows (around 20-50 grains). The heavier projectile affects the range and accuracy of the crossbow.\n",
        "6. **Caliber**: Crossbows often have a higher caliber (e.g.,.22 or.25) than bows (e.g.,.22 or.30). A higher caliber results in a longer range, but also increases the risk of over-penetration.\n",

A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot.

        " Ignoring air resistance, the forces on the balloon are gravity and buoyancy.   F = rho_air * V_balloon * g - m_balloon * g where rho is a density, and g is the gravitational acceleration. We can also write    V_balloon = m_balloon / rho_balloon so   F = m_balloon*g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) Newton II says F = ma so   a_balloon = g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) in other words, the balloon acceleration upwards depends on the ratio of densities of the surrounding air to the balloon contents. It will have an acceleration upwards equal to g if and only if rho_air/rho_balloon = 2 -- if the balloon is half as dense as the surrounding air. This is also ignoring any expansion or compression of the balloon as the outside pressure changes.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "If it weren't for air resistance, balloons would indeed rise with the same acceleration as gravity. This is because air resistance is a force that opposes the motion of an object, such as a balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a balloon is inflated and rises into the air, it is essentially in a state of free fall, with an acceleration of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s^2) due to gravity. However, air resistance acts in the opposite direction, trying to slow down the balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "If there were no air resistance, the balloon would continue to rise at the same rate as it would if it were in a vacuum. This is because the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object, so even if the velocity is the same, the force is reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if there were no air resistance, the balloon would rise with the same acceleration as gravity, but it would also rise at a much faster rate than it would if it were in a vacuum. This is why balloons often float gently to the ground, rather than falling quickly to the surface.\n",

        "I can answer this question for you, but I don't want to give you the wrong answer. If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls. So it is the difference in the direction of the air that makes the balloon fall, not the difference in the air's density.<|eot_id|>\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " _URL_0_ Thermal energy is really just the atoms in a material jiggling. The more you heat something up the more the atoms jiggle back and forth. In a gas or liquid, the atoms can move freely bouncing around off of each other, while in a solid that atoms jiggle back and forth in place. When you rub or hit two objects together some of the kinetic energy of the movement is converted into more jiggling of the atoms in each material. Blacksmiths can get a small thin piece of metal red hot just by hammering it with a big hammer. If you bounce a ball on a hard surface in a vacuum, it eventually stops bouncing. The kinetic energy of the ball isn't gone, if you could measure the temperature of the ball and floor before and after very accurately, you'd find that they are both slightly warmer.\n",

        "Friction creates heat through a process called thermal friction, also known as friction heating or friction-induced heat transfer. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Surface Contact**: When two surfaces come into contact, they transfer energy through friction.\n",
        "2. **Frictional Force**: The frictional force is generated by the interaction between the two surfaces. This force is proportional to the normal force (N) between the surfaces and the coefficient of friction (μ) between them.\n",
        "3. **Heat Generation**: As the frictional force increases, it generates heat due to the following mechanisms:\n",
        "\t* **Conduction**: Heat is transferred through conduction, where the kinetic energy of the particles is transferred from one location to another.\n",
        "\t* **Convection**: Heat is also transferred through convection, where the heated particles move and transfer heat to the surrounding air.\n",
        "\t* **Radiation**: Heat is also transferred through radiation, where the heated particles emit radiation energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Frictional Heat Transfer Mechanisms**:\n",

        "There are several mechanisms that contribute to frictional heat transfer:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Sticky Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles on the surfaces to stick together, creating a \"sticky\" frictional force.\n",
        "* **Adhesive Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the adhesive force between them can also cause the particles to stick together, generating heat.\n",
        "* **Viscous Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles to stick together, creating a viscous frictional force.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Heat Generation Rate**: The heat generation rate is influenced by the frictional force, which is proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of friction. The heat generation rate is typically highest at the point of contact and decreases as the frictional force decreases.\n",

        "In summary, friction creates heat through the generation of frictional force, which generates heat through various mechanisms, including conduction, convection, radiation, and adhesive friction.

        " Intellectual disability - basically I'm not smart enough. Learning disability - I can't learn via specific processes. Often characterized by senses I.e. auditory processing disorder. You can't learn something by hearing instructions, but given picture instructions it's easy to learn the same thing.  If a cup represents your ability to learn, a really small cup is an intellectual disability. A cup with a lid that has circular holes means the cup can only be filled a certain way (or certain ways, really).\n",

        "2. **Genetics**: Skin color is determined by the amount and distribution of melanin in the skin. People with darker skin colors have more melanin in their skin, which gives them a darker hue.\n",
        "3. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to sunlight can cause melanin production to increase, resulting in darker skin colors. This is why people from tropical regions often have darker skin colors.\n",
        "4. **Evolutionary History**: The distribution of melanin in the skin is also influenced by an individual's evolutionary history. People from regions with high levels of melanin production, such as the Amazon rainforest, have more melanin in their skin, resulting in darker skin colors.\n",

        "The combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the variation in skin colors across different populations. Here's a rough breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dark Skin**: People from tropical regions, such as those in Africa, Asia, and Indigenous Australia, often have darker skin colors due to high levels of melanin production.\n",
        "- **Medium Skin**: People from temperate regions, such as those in Europe, North America, and parts of Australia, typically have medium skin colors due to moderate levels of melanin production.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Early beginnings:** Girl Scout cookies were first introduced in 1917 by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The first recipe was a simple chocolate chip cookie made with just a few ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and chocolate chips.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quality over quantity:** Over the years, the Girl Scouts refined their cookie recipe, focusing on quality ingredients and careful baking. They used high-quality chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract to create a rich, delicious flavor.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quality control:** To ensure consistency and quality, the Girl Scouts developed a strict quality control process. They tested their cookies in small batches, using only the finest ingredients and a rigorous testing protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "**No shortcuts:** Unlike some other cookie manufacturers, the Girl Scouts didn't rely on shortcuts or preservatives to extend shelf life. Their cookies were baked fresh daily, using traditional baking methods that preserved the natural flavors and textures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attention to detail:** The Girl Scouts are known for their attention to detail, from the packaging to the branding. Their iconic brown paper bags, colorful labels, and \"Treat of the Month\" promotions have become synonymous with the brand.\n",

        "1. **Overemphasis on quantity over quality:** Companies often prioritize mass production over quality ingredients and careful baking. This can result in cookies that are bland, overly sweet, or lacking in flavor.\n",
        "2. **Lack of transparency:** Companies may not disclose the exact ingredients or manufacturing processes used in their cookies. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for consumers to trust the product.\n",
        "3. **Preservatives and additives:** Some companies may use preservatives or additives to extend shelf life, which can affect the natural flavor and texture of the cookie.\n",
        "4. **Shortcuts and automation:** Companies may rely on automated production lines or shortcuts to save time and money, which can result in cookies that are inconsistent or lacking in quality.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " Assuming no atmosphere, the force it takes to launch from the surface would be equal to the force of collision with the surface upon landing. So the gravity of the planet doesn't matter - the question of whether you can injure yourself is dependent solely on the force you can exert with your legs.\n",

        "\n",
        "On a lower gravity planet, the concept of \"jumping\" might be different from what we're used to on Earth. The lower gravity would likely affect the trajectory and landing of an object or person.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a lower gravity environment, objects would experience a greater downward acceleration, which means they would fall faster and cover more distance in a given time. This could result in a higher impact upon landing.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the severity of an impact would still depend on various factors, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Object size and shape**: A larger, irregularly shaped object would be more likely to cause significant damage upon landing. A smaller, spherical object would be less likely to cause significant damage.\n",
        "2. **Object velocity**: The higher the object's velocity upon impact, the more severe the damage would be.\n",
        "3. **Landing surface**: The type of surface the object lands on would affect the impact. A hard surface would be more likely to cause severe damage than a soft surface.\n",
        "4. **Gravity**: Even on a lower gravity planet, the gravitational force would still be present. However, the reduced gravity might make it more challenging to control the object's descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these factors, it's likely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment. However, the severity of the impact would still depend on the specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate this, consider the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "* If an object were to land on a hard surface in a lower gravity environment, it could be severely injured due to the rapid deceleration upon impact.\n",
        "* If an object were to land on a soft surface, such as a thick layer of foam or a large, soft-bodied creature, it might be less likely to cause significant damage.\n",
        "* If an object were to land in a very low gravity environment, such as on a moon or a planet with a very low surface gravity, the object might be able to cover more distance in a given time, leading to a higher impact upon landing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the lower gravity environment would likely result in a higher impact upon landing, the severity of the impact would still depend on various factors. It's unlikely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment, but the impact would still be significant.<|eot_id|>\n",

But if the gravity is 1/10th that of earth, you could jump 10 times your height and still land with a low velocity, and not be injured.

The HDF is a famous image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Here's why not everyone sees the same colors:\\n\\n1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.\\n2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the \\\"optical passband.\\\" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.\\n3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the \\\"color gamut.\\\" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.\\n4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.\\n\\nIn summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>\",\n          \"Deep-frying a fish involves submerging it in hot oil, which causes the bones and tough parts to become soft and gelatinous. This is because the heat breaks down the connective tissues that hold the bones together, making them more tender and edible.\\n\\nWhen you deep-fry a fish, the following processes occur:\\n\\n1. **Heat denaturation**: The heat from the oil denatures the proteins in the connective tissue, making them more accessible to enzymes.\\n2. **Breakdown of collagen**: The heat breaks down the collagen, a key component of connective tissue, making it less rigid and more tender.\\n3. **Hydrolysis**: The heat also hydrolyzes the proteins, making them more easily broken down and absorbed by the enzymes in the fish.\\n\\nThis process is not unique to deep-frying. Grilling and steaming can also cause the bones and tough parts to become soft, but the mechanism is slightly different.\\n\\nGrilling and steaming cause the heat to break down the proteins in the connective tissue, but they don't necessarily denature the collagen or hydrolyze the proteins as much as deep-frying does.\\n\\nThe reason why deep-frying is more effective at making bones and tough parts edible is that it:\\n\\n* **Leaves more collagen intact**: The heat breaks down some of the collagen, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining collagen and make the bones and tough parts more tender.\\n* **Leaves more connective tissue intact**: The heat also breaks down some of the connective tissue, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining connective tissue and make the bones and tough parts more tender.\\n\\nOverall, the combination of heat denaturation, breakdown of collagen, and hydrolysis makes bones and tough parts more tender and edible when deep-fried.<|eot_id|>\",\n          \"Different foods of the same mass (mass) have different amounts of calories due to variations in their composition. Here's why:\\n\\n1. **Protein content**: Foods with different protein contents have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of lean chicken breast (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 180-200 calories, while a serving of lean beef (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 250-300 calories.\\n2. **Carbohydrate content**: Carbohydrates are a significant source of calories in many foods. Different types of carbohydrates, such as whole grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes, have varying amounts of calories. For instance, a serving of whole grain rice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of starchy vegetable (such as broccoli) contains approximately 50-60 calories.\\n3. **Fat content**: Fats are another important source of calories in many foods. Different types of fats, such as saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of avocado (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 300-400 calories, while a serving of olive oil (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 120-180 calories.\\n4. **Vitamin and mineral content**: Foods with different nutrient profiles have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of vitamin D-fortified milk (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of vitamin D-fortified cereal (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 50-60 calories.\\n5. **Water content**: Foods with varying water contents have different amounts of calories. For example, a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories, while a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories.\\n\\nTo calculate the calorie content of a specific food, you need to know its composition, which includes its protein, carbohydrate, fat, and water content.

There are many different colors in the disks and they can be very different in appearance. But what i find most interesting about them is that they all look the way they do, and it seems to me that there is a real balance between the different colours and the various properties that make them so different from each other. [re: [post]] reply: well, you just donyou really dont have to think about it as a matter of fact. A lot of people have seen a disk that looks like it had been painted. You just can't see it. For example, if you looked at a normal black disk and you saw that the blackness was not very bad, that would be a pretty good picture. Or you could see a black screen with a red background and a green background. So, even though you can see the screen and there's a nice contrast between them, the contrast is very poor. That is, it doesn't make any difference to the image quality of your computer when you see them in real life.[re-post:] i agree with you. When you read a book about a machine, do you think that it has a good color scheme? If so, then why does it look like a bad one?you know, when i read books, my mind is just like that of an average person. People say that their minds are like this. My mind says, \\\"this is good, this is bad.\\\" but when they look into the computer, they have this bad image, or the bad aspect. They look in to this image and then they think, maybe this picture is better than this one, but it isn't. The computer is like, okay, what is it? That's what they say. And the truth is this computer has this good aspect, which is not good. However, there are people who do this, who think this thing is really good because they see how good it really is. This is what you have. Because they don`t see that, because there aren`ts like these, people are not able to understand what it means. Therefore, in my opinion, a picture like some kind of computer screen is worse than an ordinary picture, to be honest. As far as i can tell, most people see this as the best picture that can stand up to them if they use the right tool. To me, some of them are a bit bit confused. Maybe they just use a different tool, like an old computer monitor. Anyway, while i understand that these things are good things, why do people think they should use this kind, especially for a laptop? To be fair, these are things that i would like to see in computers, where you would have a more accurate understanding of what the difference is between a desktop and an \\\"interpreter\\\" (i. E. The machine that is running the program). In that case, would you prefer the laptop over the desktop? For a long time, we used to say, no, those were bad things. Nowadays, our opinions are different. We have different opinions, for example. Sometimes people say they want a better computer because of this machine. No, sometimes, good people want to use computers that are better. Some people like them because that's their way of doing things and to make money. Others don\\ufffdt like those machines because people dont care about the fact that computers are bad. These things should not be used in such a way. Those are the opinions of those who have never seen this sort of thing, so i have no idea why people would say it was bad or that. Besides, as far, are there any differences in what people use? There is no difference between those two opinions. What is interesting is you are saying that in most computer screens, color is used. Well then, can you show me something like what that means? I want you to show a white screen. On a blue screen, on a yellow screen you might say \\\"what is your view of that?\\\" or it might be \\\"i like white.\\\" you can show them that you want them to look more like blue. Your computer does not have that feature. Instead, your screen uses a combination of white and black. Why do we use that? Because the whites have the opposite effect, whereas the blacks have something more in common with the white. One might wonder, how can we know that a color in a screen can have an effect on the other?\",\n          \"It's not the fish itself, but the way it cooks. It's just a matter of how the meat cooks and how it does so. In the beginning of cooking, the water needs to be boiling to keep it from getting too hot. The water that's still boiling needs a bit more cooking. In addition to that, you'll need to add a little bit of meat or poultry. These meat-skewer recipes are often called deep-frying because they are very simple. They are usually made using a deep fryer or grill. You will also need some other cooking ingredients. Ingredients:- 1 tablespoon olive oil(about 2 cups) - 1 onion, finely choppeddirections: heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Remove from heat and add the garlic and saute until fragrant. If you want to use a separate sauce, add some olive, and stir until combined. Cook for 2 minutes on each side until translucent. Serve immediately. For the cheese: add 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1 1\\u20442 cups water, 2 tablespoons salt, 4 ounces of ground pepper, 3 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt. Put the chicken and cheese in the refrigerator. Let the sauce cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. When the seasonings are completely dissolved, remove from the heat, allow to cool and cut into small pieces. Place the skillet on the center rack. Heat 1 cup (about 1 cups of water) of oil on medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, cover, pour in 2 teaspoons of sauce and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until oil is dissolved and the mixture has a nice, thick consistency. Turn off the burner and allow the liquid to evaporate. Allow to set for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.\",\n          \"The body is always trying to find the right amount of energy for the body to use to maintain its health. The body needs to know if it has enough energy to function properly. The amount it needs is determined by the amount that is consumed in a given day. Therefore, if you have a high energy intake, you will need to consume a lot more calories to get to that energy. Answer: the calories in the diet are the number of foods that are used to make the meal. A low amount will burn more energy than a great amount. So, in order to have the optimal amount, the energy needs must be very high. If you are on a low calorie diet, your body must use as much energy as possible to fuel the metabolism. It is very important to choose the correct amount for your food. For example, one of my favorite foods is bacon. I used it as a breakfast for a long time and have been eating it ever since. But, it seems that the bacon that i am eating has a very low energy content. This is because i have not had bacon for over 5 years. You can read more about my experience at http://www. Fatty-lifestyle. Com/blog/how-to-eat-your-healthy-foods/ . Question: can i eat a different type of food at the end of a meal? Answer: yes. There is no difference in calories, carbs, protein, and fat content between different types of meals. As long as you eat the proper amount each day, there is a good chance that you won't get any extra calories. Also, eating a higher amount does not make you fat. What is the difference between a lower amount and a larger amount? The difference is more important if there are two or more people. When you add in that one person, then the caloric difference from the other person will be larger. In fact, that's why you should use a smaller amount or a whole food like rice or wheat.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GPT2_Finetuned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"~~it's possible to change the frequencies of light that are reflected by the disk.~~ in the case of the red green and blue lights, the frequency of these light waves is a bit different than what you would see in an actual mirror, so it is not possible for your brain to filter out the \\\"correct\\\" frequencies.

Is, \\\"why\\\" is that the \\\"extra calories in foods are more calorie dense? I believe it is more in bulk. Calories. Some foods have more than others, some calories, like pasta. Food. Or foods with a calorie content that have fewer calories may be easier to eat. Not all calories to get. Source: _link_1_ _food_ food in general, no doubt, calories _calories are calories per gram. No matter what you eat, that _is_ calories stored in calories is not. Calorie density, not volume. \\\"calorie density. Nutrition facts and calories_ in grams per serving. All of them are energy content in calorie are not calories burned, volume, kcalories per unit of mass, grams. Weight and weight of calorie. As the saying \\\"further, calorates calories consumed by food _c_ calorie, which is food a food_. Energy, _page_: calories/kcalor food calorie_ (calculation of kcal, weight, mass of weight. Kcal (in calories). Calorie of a measurement of matter. Mass. Of body mass (how much food). _k= mass and energy contained in units of foods _distance from food_. Weight = calories (1 calorie per calorie mass mass - weight or mass) of water per food units, quantity of product of item. Total energy consumed. By volume of material (m) in volume (amount of thing.

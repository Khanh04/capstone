"Why is the ""Black Death"" mentioned so often in western history but not Chinese history even though it originated there?","The Black Death is a very famous event in European history. It was a major factor in the rise of the nation-states of Europe. It's not like that in China. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China.

The plague didn't even make it to China. If you're interested in reading more about the Black Death, I recommend the book *The Plague* by Robin Brooks. It's a great read, and it's very well written.<|eot_id|>","The ""Black Death"" originated in the Middle East and was introduced to Europe through the Silk Road. European records of the plague are limited and often biased. In Chinese culture, the plague is often seen as a natural disaster or a punishment from heaven.","The ""Black Death"" is a historical phenomenon that occurred in Europe and spread globally, but its significance in Chinese history is largely forgotten. Limited European records, cultural sensitivity, and a lack of European influence have contributed to this lack of documentation. Archaeological evidence is also scarce in China. However, Chinese historians have written about the plague in their books, and there are records of outbreaks in China during the 14th century. Despite these efforts, much more work needs to be done to fully understand the plague's historical significance in China.",0,1,1
How historically accurate is the show The Last Kingdom on Netflix?,"I've watched the first season of the show and I'm not sure if you are asking for historical accuracy, but I would say that it is mostly accurate, except for the characters.

"If our DNA varies from person to person, how do we know how closely human DNA resembles that of orangutans?","Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes. Each gene has 2 alleles, which are the two versions of the gene. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. The alleles are called *alleles* because they are not the same, but the same type of allele is called a *allele* and the *alleles* themselves are called *alleles*. In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the human chromosome has 46 *alleles*. The orangutan has 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the orangutan chromosome has 46 *alleles*. So, when we look at the human chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*, and when we look at the orangutan chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*. This means that the orangutan chromosome is 46% similar to the human chromosome, and the human chromosome is 46% similar to the orangutan chromosome.<|eot_id|>","The first step is to sequence the DNA of a human or orangutan. This involves breaking the DNA into smaller pieces and then reassembling them into a complete sequence.

Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"I have a theory. Perfumes are expensive, and you are going to want to buy a lot of them. So you want to buy the most expensive one.

Why are you not allowed to donate blood for about a week and a half after taking antibiotic medication?,"You can donate blood for a short time after taking antibiotics, but you should wait at least 7 days. Why? Because the antibiotics are interfering with your immune system. Your immune system is responsible for fighting off infections, and the antibiotics are interfering with it. If you take antibiotics for too long, your immune system will be weakened, making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may develop a condition called ""blood dyscrasia"". This is a condition where your blood is abnormal, and you will have difficulty producing enough red blood cells. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may also develop a condition called ""blood clotting"". This is where your blood gets too thick, and it is harder for your blood to clot.

"Why would someone have an ""Out of body experience"" after being seriously injured?","I'm not sure I understand your question. The question is ""why would someone have an out of body experience after being seriously injured"". I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing. So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead. The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.<|eot_id|>","An Out-of-Body (OBE) experience can occur after a serious injury.

What would happen if the Earth's polarity switched?,"It's possible, but not very likely. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the core. This is what causes the poles to change. The core is made up of molten iron and a small amount of nickel. The molten iron is the one that is moving, so the magnetic field is generated by the movement of the molten iron. This movement is driven by the heat from the core. The heat is generated by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. These elements are radioactive, which means they decay very quickly. The decay rate is very high, and the decay of these elements is what drives the movement of the molten iron.

Why is our food hole the same as our air hole? Doesn't it only result in things like choking?,"Choking is a very common issue. There are two reasons. 1. Air is the most common gas we breathe, and so we are used to breathing air. 2. When we choke, the air goes down our throat and into our lungs. The problem is that the air isn't being drawn down our throat, so it gets stuck in our throat. The reason it gets stuck is that the air is trying to go down the wrong pipe. If you have a tube that's 1 inch long, it can be difficult to fit something smaller into it. That's what happens when you choke. If you were to breathe through a straw, you could easily get a piece of food in your throat, but you wouldn't choke.<|eot_id|>","Our food hole and air hole refer to the spaces inside the nostrils that allow air to pass through when we breathe.

How Photoshopping something out of a picture works.,"The original picture is a high-resolution image. When you edit it, you are essentially replacing parts of the image with new parts. The new parts are usually the same size and shape as the old parts, but they are not the same color. This means that the image will look like the old image, but it will also be slightly different. The software will then take a new image and compare it to the old image. If the new image is the same size and shape as the old image, the software will use the old image and replace the parts that were replaced. If the new image is smaller, the software will use the new image and remove parts of the old image. If the new image is larger, the software will use the new image and add parts to the old image. This is why the software will sometimes make the image look blurry or distorted.

Why do enzymes denature when sitting out at room temperature but not inside our bodies?,"Enzymes are proteins that are made up of many different amino acids. The amino acids are linked together by a special molecule called a peptide bond. The peptide bonds are very strong and can withstand a lot of heat. The reason enzymes denature is because the heat causes the peptide bonds to break. The amino acids are so small that they can fit into a tight space and the peptide bonds are so strong that they can withstand the heat. If the enzyme is exposed to room temperature, the temperature is not high enough to cause the peptide bonds to break.

"How come there is sunlight on Earth but right outside of Earth, in space, its pitch black?","The Sun's light is very, very bright, but it's only 6% of the total energy of the light that is emitted by the Sun. The Earth is about 30% of the total energy of the Sun's light. The Earth receives 4.3 watts of light per square meter, while the Sun receives 136 watts per square meter. This means that the Earth receives 30 times more light than the Sun, but it receives only about 1/5 as much energy. So the Earth is brighter than the Sun, but not by much. The Earth is also very, very close to the Sun, so the light it receives is much more intense than the light that reaches the Moon. The Moon is about 384,000 kilometers away from the Sun, while the Earth is only about 384,000 kilometers away from the Sun. So the light that reaches the Moon is much less intense than the light that reaches the Earth.<|eot_id|>","On Earth, the Sun appears bright because its orbit is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. This means that the Sun's light has to travel through a significant portion of the Earth's atmosphere to reach the surface. In contrast, other planets in our solar system have much closer orbits to the Sun. This results in less scattering of sunlight, which makes the Sun appear fainter.","The apparent difference in sunlight between Earth and other planets in our solar system is due to their orbits around the Sun. The tilt of their orbits causes the amount of sunlight reaching their surfaces to vary, with Earth's orbit being tilted at 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. This results in more scattering of sunlight, making Earth appear brighter, while other planets appear fainter. For example, Mars appears as a rocky world with little atmosphere, while Venus appears as a bright world due to its close orbit.",0,1,1

"Is there a genetic upper limit for size? For example, can we selectively breed largeness in dogs to get them to the size of bear?","There is no upper limit for size. Dogs can grow to 100kg+ and cats to 100kg+. It's just a matter of how much energy you want to spend. For example, a dog needs to eat a lot more than a cat. So you can breed a dog that eats more food than a cat. But it's not the dog that will be larger. It's the cat that will be larger. The reason for this is because a cat's body is designed to be smaller. It has to be because it's a predator. It has to be smaller than the dogs that it will be hunting. So it has evolved to be smaller. It's the same reason why humans evolved to be smaller than lions. It's not because humans are smaller than lions.

How do we measure distances in space?,"The most common method is the parallax method. The Earth is a big ball, and when you look at something in the sky that is very far away, the Earth will look to be moving in the sky. The distance between the Earth and the object is called the parallax, and when you measure it, you can calculate the distance between the Earth and the object. The problem is that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the distance between the Earth and the object can vary, so the parallax method only works for very far away objects. The most precise way to measure the distance is to use the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is a number that tells you how fast the universe is expanding. If you know how fast the universe is expanding, you can calculate how far away a very far away object is.<|eot_id|>","Measuring distances in space is a challenging task due to the vast distances between celestial objects and the limitations of current technology.

Do two objects ever actually touch on a molecular level?,"Yes, two objects can *touch* on a molecular level. The molecules can get close enough that they can interact with each other. The way this can happen is through a process called [van der Waals forces](_URL_1_). These forces are so weak that they are generally not noticed, but they are there. They are caused by the molecules in the two objects coming close enough to interact with each other. These forces are responsible for things like [capillary action](_URL_0_). You can see the effect of these forces in everyday life. When you pour water into a glass, the water will take the shape of the glass. This is because the water molecules are interacting with the glass molecules. To get a better sense of the strength of the van der Waals forces, look at the [Mie scattering](_URL_2_) of light.

Why do bows have a longer range than crossbows (considering crossbows have more force)?,"Crossbows have a longer range because they can be mounted on a person's shoulder and fired at a more consistent rate. The bowstring has a lower mass, which means it can be used to generate a greater force. In addition, crossbows are mounted on a person's shoulder, which allows for a more consistent aim. A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot. The bowstring is not pulled back before firing, which means it can be fired more quickly.<|eot_id|>","Bows and crossbows have different mechanisms for propelling arrows, which affects their range. The longer the string, the more energy it takes to stretch and release.

Bows use flexible strings, which stretch and release farther, allowing for longer ranges. Crossbows, on the other hand, use heavier arrows and stronger strings, resulting in higher speeds.

If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"I can answer this question for you, but I don't want to give you the wrong answer. If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls. So it is the difference in the direction of the air that makes the balloon fall, not the difference in the air's density.<|eot_id|>","If it weren't for air resistance, balloons would rise with the same acceleration as gravity. This is because air resistance is the force that opposes the motion of the balloon, causing it to decelerate instead of accelerate. If we were to remove the air resistance from a balloon, the air inside the balloon would expand, creating an increase in air pressure. This would cause the balloon to expand and rise with an upward force, similar to gravity. However, there's a catch. If the balloon is released into a vacuum, theAir inside the Balloon would not expand, and the buoyant force would be zero.","A balloon rises with the same acceleration as gravity when it has air inside it.

Why is there no system of moderation to license news reporters similar to how engineers/doctors are licensed to design buildings or treat patients?,"If you're talking about the US news media, then there's a system in place. Every news agency has a license from the FCC, and they have to pay a fee for it. There's a system in place for reporting, which is based on a code of ethics. This code of ethics is designed to help prevent reporters from getting in trouble. For example, if a reporter breaks the code of ethics, and gets caught, they can be fired. But if a reporter breaks the code of ethics, and gets caught, they can be fined. The FCC also has a system in place for reporting, which is based on a rating system.

Unlike engineers and doctors, journalists are not required by law to undergo a licensing process to become a journalist. There is no universally accepted standard for what constitutes ""good"" journalism.","Journalists are not entirely protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, as they can still publish false or misleading information. However, there are several reasons why journalists can report inaccuracies: 1. Professional ethics dictate accurate reporting. 2. Lack of formal training or certification requirements. 3. No licensing system is in place. 4. No universally accepted standard for ""good"" journalism. 5. Journalists are not held accountable for their actions. To address these issues, efforts are underway to establish a system of moderation and accountability for journalists. This includes: 1. Fact-checking organizations to verify the accuracy of news articles. 2. Professional organizations with codes of",0,1,1

Why do I get headaches from 3D movies?,"The reason why you get headaches from 3D movies is because your eyes are moving around. When you are watching a 3D movie, your eyes are moving in a circle. The reason why you get headaches is because your brain is not able to process all the information at once. Your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world. When your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world, it gets tired. This tiredness is what causes headaches. The reason why 3D movies work is because they are not like a 2D movie. Your brain is not able to process all the information at once. It can only process 2D information at a time. So when you are watching a 3D movie, your brain is constantly trying to process all the information in the 3D world. It is constantly trying to process all the information. This causes the tiredness.<|eot_id|>","There are several reasons why you might experience headaches from 3D movies. The extra layer of depth can create a sense of visual fatigue, making it more difficult to focus and relax. Some people are more prone to motion-induced headaches, such as migraines.","Watching 3D movies can cause headaches due to several reasons. Motion sickness, combined with the need to follow moving images, can trigger headaches in some people. The brain gets confused when trying to process multiple images simultaneously, leading to headaches. Additionally, watching 3D movies can cause eye strain, and some people may be more prone to motion-induced headaches. To alleviate headaches, try taking breaks, wearing eye protection, adjusting screen brightness and contrast, and reducing the volume. If headaches persist, consult a doctor or optometrist for personalized advice.",0,1,0
Why do people have different skin colours?,"Humans are a lot like plants. We have a lot of different genes that determine our traits. When we're born, we have all of these genes and the ones that are active determine how our skin, hair, eyes, and other traits will be. So if you have a gene for dark skin, you will have darker skin. If you have a gene for light skin, you will have lighter skin. There are also genes that are active in other parts of our bodies, like the eyes. So if you have a gene for blue eyes, you will have blue eyes. If you have a gene for brown eyes, you will have brown eyes. So the skin, hair, eyes, and other traits are all determined by genes. When we're born, we have all of these genes active. So when we're growing up, the genes that are active determine what traits we'll have.<|eot_id|>","The skin color of a person is determined by the amount and type of melanin in their skin.

"How did girlscout cookies get to be so good, and why don't corporations with much more money make better cookies?","The Girl Scouts have a strict recipe that they stick to. They don't allow any variation, except for things like the color of the cookies. They also don't allow any additives, except for salt. They also make their own sugar, and their own flour. They also bake their own cookies in small batches, and they have a very low turnover rate. This allows them to keep their cookies fresh, and they also keep the cookies from getting stale. They also have a lot of control over what goes into the cookies. They can choose the flavor, and the color, and they can choose the amount of sugar, and the amount of butter. They can also choose the size of the cookies, and the shape. This allows them to make the cookies exactly what you want, and they don't have to rely on a third party to make the cookies.

"On a lower gravity planet, would it be possible to jump high enough that you could injure yourself when you land? Or would it be impossible for the impact to be that severe?","You could land on a planet with a very low gravity and still be able to injure yourself. The problem is that the gravity would be so low, you wouldn't be able to jump very high. But the impact would still be very severe. If you are on a planet with a gravity of 1g, you could jump 3-4 times your height and still land with a high velocity, and be injured. But if the gravity is 1/10th that of earth, you could jump 10 times your height and still land with a low velocity, and not be injured. So, yes, you could injure yourself by jumping very high, but it would be very unlikely.<|eot_id|>","On a lower gravity planet, the concept of ""injury"" might be different from what we experience on Earth. Lower gravity would likely result in a different physics, and the possibility of severe injuries from a jump would depend on various factors.

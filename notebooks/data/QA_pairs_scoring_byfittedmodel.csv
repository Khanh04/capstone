1,How historically accurate is the show The Last Kingdom on Netflix?,"I've watched the first season of the show and I'm not sure if you are asking for historical accuracy, but I would say that it is mostly accurate, except for the characters. I am not sure if you are asking for accuracy in terms of the setting, but I am sure that the show is mostly accurate in terms of the setting. The show is set in the 9th century, and the show's setting is the 9th century, so it is accurate. The show is set in a very similar time period to the Viking Age, so it is accurate in terms of clothing, weapons, and the like. However, the show is set in a very different time period than the Viking Age, and so it is not accurate in terms of politics, religion, and culture. I'm not sure if you are asking for accuracy in terms of the characters, but I would say that the show is mostly accurate.

Or do we HAVE to eat in order to live?","There's a lot of food out there. You just need to have a good supply of it.

Each gene has 2 alleles, which are the two versions of the gene. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles.

In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the human chromosome has 46 *alleles*. The orangutan has 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair has 2 genes, and each gene has 2 alleles. So, the orangutan chromosome has 46 *alleles*.  So, when we look at the human chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*, and when we look at the orangutan chromosome, we can see that it has 46 *alleles*.

7,Why are advertisements for colognes and perfumes so strange?,"I have a theory. Perfumes are expensive, and you are going to want to buy a lot of them. So you want to buy the most expensive one. That's why you see them in a lot of ads. You want to buy a lot of them, so you want to show them off.  Also, perfumes are very strong, so you want to be able to smell them from a distance. So you want to show them off from a distance.  I think the other reason is that perfume ads are often very expensive to make.

15,Why can we smell food more easily when the food is hot?,"Smelling food is more of a sensation than a smell, it's just your nose detecting molecules. When you smell something, it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules. When the molecules are hot, they are moving around more quickly, so your nose can detect them more easily.  The hot food is also more volatile, so it's more likely that it will be able to escape your nose and into your lungs. This is why you can smell food even if it's cold, but you can't smell it if it's frozen.",1,0.995,1,0.571,it's just your nose detecting molecules,it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules

23,"Why would someone have an ""Out of body experience"" after being seriously injured?","I'm not sure I understand your question. The question is ""why would someone have an out of body experience after being seriously injured"". I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing.  So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead.  The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.",1,0.993,1,0.541,the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead,The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead

26,how can public schools and universities in the US have time off for select religious holidays? Doesn't it violate separation of church and state?,"The Supreme Court ruled that schools and universities have the right to allow religious holidays to be observed, but they cannot make it mandatory. They can't just tell you that you have to go to church on Monday, but they can't tell you that you have to go to church on Tuesday.  The reason for this is that you can't force someone to go to church. You can't make someone go to church if they don't want to. You can't make someone go to church if they are busy. You can't make someone go to church if they don't have the time.  But you can make someone go to church if they want to. You can't make someone go to church if they don't want to.

In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more. In cold weather, the air is much drier, which is why it smells so much more.  In the case of the nose, cold air is more dense than warm air, so it's more likely that the cold air is carrying more particles (like dust, pollen, etc.) into the nostrils.

The reason for this is because a cat's body is designed to be smaller. It has to be because it's a predator. It has to be smaller than the dogs that it will be hunting.

You can see the effect of these forces in everyday life. When you pour water into a glass, the water will take the shape of the glass.

The bowstring has a lower mass, which means it can be used to generate a greater force. In addition, crossbows are mounted on a person's shoulder, which allows for a more consistent aim. A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot.

87,If it wasn't for air resistance would balloons rise with the same acceleration as gravity?,"I can answer this question for you, but I don't want to give you the wrong answer. If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls.

88,How exactly does friction create heat?,"When you rub two things together, you're creating a transfer of heat. The two things are moving at different speeds, so they transfer heat. The speed of the moving things are so different that the heat is transferred at a high rate, so it's very quickly transferred to the surface of the objects. The heat transfer is so fast that it can be considered to be the same as ""friction"".  The heat is transferred to the surface because the objects are moving at different speeds.

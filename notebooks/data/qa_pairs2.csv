"Can Conservation of Energy and the ""many worlds"" interpretation of Quantum Mechanics be reconsiled?","This is a great question, and I have always thought about it.  The idea is that the wavefunction for a quantum system is a generalization of the concept of probability. If you think about it, a wavefunction is just a probability distribution. You can interpret this as a way of saying that the probability of something happening is proportional to its value. If you have a system where you can only measure a single value, the probability of that value is 1.",1,0.333,This is a great question,a wavefunction is just a probability distribution
From 1700/ 1600 backwards - did people write sci-fi stories?,"Yes, they did. The [Mandeville Scrolls] from the 10th century are a good example of this.

"We say that gravitational acceleration here on earth is 9.81m/s^2. Is this a constant, or is it influenced by the mass of the falling object?","The force of gravity is constant and depends only on the mass of the object. This is because the gravitational force depends on the mass of the object, and the gravitational field is defined as the force per unit mass. The gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth is 9.8 m/s^2, which is constant. The reason for this is that the earth is a spherically symmetric body, and the gravitational field is also spherically symmetric.",1,0.643,The force of gravity is constant and depends only on the mass of the object,This is because the gravitational force depends on the mass of the object
Do birds ever fly just got fun or is every flight purposeful?,"They don't fly for fun, they fly for survival. Most birds that fly for fun are migratory birds that migrate to warmer climates to escape harsh weather. They're not just flying for fun, they're flying because they need to. They're flying to find food, to find shelter, to find mates, to find places to raise their young, and so on.",0,0.667,to find shelter,to find mates
"Why does it feel good to crack joints, and is it bad to crack them?","I think the feeling of cracking joints is just a natural response to injury.  When you crack your joints, you're essentially breaking the connection between the bones, and this is usually accompanied by a feeling of relief. The cracking of the joint is the breaking of the joint, and the feeling of relief is the release of the pressure that was building up in the joint.",1,0.483,The cracking of the joint is the breaking of the joint,and the feeling of relief is the release of the pressure that was building up in the joint
How are sport sponsors able to justify the money spent on a club/player?,"I don't know about the NFL, but the NBA has a very similar model. They pay a player a salary, but they also pay the team a large sum of money, which is then used to pay the player. This is why you often see players in the NBA who are not the best players, but are still on the team, because the team is able to afford it.",1,0.353,They pay a player a salary,but they also pay the team a large sum of money
Why is road kill most always off to the side of the road when it usually is hit within the middle of the road?,"There are a few reasons. 1. The most common cause of road kill is animals. Most animals are big and can't get out of the way quickly. They're also very unpredictable. So, if you're driving a car and you see a road kill, you can't help but wonder if it was an animal. 2. Most animals are going to be moving at a speed that's fast enough to not be able to be seen.",1,0.19,The most common cause of road kill is animals,if you're driving a car and you see a road kill
Why are humans the only “intelligent” species on the planet?,"Because we're the only species that has been around for long enough to develop the tools to do things like communicate, and then develop technology to do things like build things.

Why do we perceive temperature in air differently than in water?,"There are two main ways we perceive temperature. One is through your skin. When you touch something, you are getting a temperature reading from the surface of your skin. This is because the surface of your skin is actually made of cells that are all connected together. When you touch something, the cells in your skin are in contact with the surface of the thing you are touching. This allows the cells to exchange heat with the surface of the thing.",0,1.0,When you touch something,When you touch something
"In movies when the actors snort cocaine, do they actually snort powder, what is it, and how is it done to make it seem real?","There are several different types of cocaine, and the most common is hydrochloride.

"What is the purpose of having designated ""emergency exits"" on buildings? Why not just have more ordinary doors that don't sound an alarm when opening?","Emergency exits are designed to be open in a way that doesn't allow people to get stuck. They have to be able to be opened quickly and easily, so you can get out of a building quickly if something happens. They're usually designed to be open in a way that allows you to open them with a single key, and they usually have a mechanism that allows you to open them with a key without a second key.",1,0.615,They're usually designed to be open in a way that allows you to open them with a single key,and they usually have a mechanism that allows you to open them with a key without a second key
how does destructive interference of waves (e.g. noise cancellation) hold to the laws of conservation of energy?,"I'm not sure what you're referring to with destructive interference, but I'll address the concept of destructive interference with a simple example. Let's say that we have two waves with amplitudes of 1. The first wave is traveling along the x-axis, and the second wave is traveling along the y-axis.

How are there permanent tatoos and scars?,"You can't have permanent tattoos. The ink will fade over time, and the tattoo will eventually be removed.  The only permanent tattoo is a scar. A scar is a small, permanent mark on the skin, caused by an injury to the skin. It is essentially a wound that has healed, but has left a mark on the skin. The scar is permanent, and will not heal.  Tattoos are a different thing.",1,0.615,permanent mark on the skin,but has left a mark on the skin
How did the Soviet media cover Vietnam War?,"The Soviet media was not very good at covering the Vietnam War.  One of the most famous Soviet journalists who covered the Vietnam War was [Alexander Litvinenko], a Russian journalist who was working in Hong Kong when he was poisoned. His death was a major scandal in the USSR, and he was eventually awarded the Order of Lenin for his bravery.  However, it was the US that had the most journalists covering the war.",1,0.444,The Soviet media was not very good at covering the Vietnam War,One of the most famous Soviet journalists who covered the Vietnam War was [Alexander Litvinenko]
Why is it that people tend to recall things once they have seen them again and not immediately beforehand?,"It's called the [forgetting curve]. It's not really a single thing, but rather a collection of different factors that contribute to it. The basic idea is that the brain has a limited amount of capacity for storing memories, and it can only hold so much information at a time. When you first encounter a new piece of information, you're not going to be able to store it in your memory, so you'll forget it.",1,0.308,It's called the [forgetting curve],It's not really a single thing
"Is the compass direction of the moon in the night sky, relative to the earth, predictable?","The Earth's rotation is very slow, about 24 hours. So it takes about 24 hours for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. The Moon is orbiting the Earth at a speed of about 1/2 the speed of the Earth's rotation. This means that the Moon is actually moving relative to the Earth at about 1/2 the speed of the Earth's rotation.",0,0.744,The Moon is orbiting the Earth at a speed of about 1/2 the speed of the Earth's rotation,This means that the Moon is actually moving relative to the Earth at about 1/2 the speed of the Earth's rotation
how do we know when our sun will go supernova?,"We know for certain that the sun will go supernova, because it's a well known fact that the sun is going to go supernova.

Is there an object that floats on moving water but sinks otherwhise?,"It's called a [float].  The reason is that the density of water is less than the density of most other objects. When you have an object of a certain density, it will float. When you have an object of a different density, it will sink. The reason for this is that the density of the object is the ratio of the mass of the object to the volume of the object.",0,0.889,When you have an object of a certain density,When you have an object of a different density
Do internally ingested radionuclides tend to accumulate in certain tissues as opposed to others?,"It depends on the type of radionuclide and the organ it's in.  For example, you can't just eat a whole can of radium. It will only be in your stomach and small intestine. That's where you would be most likely to ingest it. The rest of your body would have a hard time getting rid of it.  The most common radionuclides ingested are tritium (3H) and carbon-14.",1,0.25,It depends on the type of radionuclide and the organ it's in,The most common radionuclides ingested are tritium (3H) and carbon-14
Why is it that net neutrality seems to be threatened every year?,> Why is it that net neutrality seems to be threatened every year? It's not.

How did people wake themselves up before alarm clocks?,"In the past, people would wake up to a fire alarm. They would go to the window and see the fire department come to the house. The fire department would arrive, and the firefighters would put out the fire. This would wake people up, and they would go back to sleep. Then the fire department would leave, and the alarm would go off again, and people would wake up. It was a lot easier to get out of bed if you had a fire to fight.",0,0.727,The fire department would arrive,Then the fire department would leave
How feasible is Tesla's wireless energy transmission?,"The only way to transmit energy wirelessly is to use electromagnetic waves, and this is the same way that radio waves are used to transmit energy. In fact, radio waves are the only way to transmit energy wirelessly, and they are already used for a variety of purposes, including radio broadcasting. Tesla's idea is to use a high frequency electromagnetic wave, which is a type of radio wave, to transmit energy wirelessly.

how can hawking radiation escape a black hole when light can't?,"The Hawking radiation is actually emitted by the black hole itself, not the outside of the black hole. It is a consequence of quantum mechanics, which states that the black hole should emit radiation due to quantum fluctuations in the vacuum. The reason it's called Hawking radiation is because it's named after Stephen Hawking, who first proposed it. The radiation is actually the result of the black hole being pulled apart by the gravitational field, and thus the black hole's mass is changing.",1,0.5,The Hawking radiation is actually emitted by the black hole itself,The radiation is actually the result of the black hole being pulled apart by the gravitational field
Why does the range of remote controls and car keys increase when you hold them to your head?,"It's because your head is a bigger surface area compared to your body. This means that the radio waves have to be reflected off your head to reach the receiver, and the receiver has to be closer to your head. This is why you can get a better reception at your head than your body.  The other reason is that the radio waves have to travel a greater distance through the air to reach the receiver, so the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases.",1,0.526,This means that the radio waves have to be reflected off your head to reach the receiver,The other reason is that the radio waves have to travel a greater distance through the air to reach the receiver
How did genders arise?,"There are many theories, but the most popular is that the idea of gender arose from the social and biological differences between males and females. It was a natural way to explain the differences between these two sexes, and it was a way to explain why males were born with different physical traits than females. This is the same reason that we have different sexes.

how does spicy food create the sensation of heat?,"Spicy food triggers the release of a chemical called capsaicin. This chemical binds to the TRPV1 receptor in the skin, which is a receptor that is involved in the detection of pain and heat. The binding of capsaicin to the receptor causes a chemical signal to be transmitted to the brain, which interprets this as heat. This is why the heat from spicy food is not just the capsaicin itself, but also the chemical signal it triggers in the brain.",1,0.37,This chemical binds to the TRPV1 receptor in the skin,The binding of capsaicin to the receptor causes a chemical signal to be transmitted to the brain
What compels a microorganism to reproduce?,"They don't. It's a myth that's been debunked. Microorganisms do reproduce, but it's not the same as the way we reproduce.

"Why do some animals have recreational sex, while others do not?","It's not necessarily a good idea to assume that something is ""recreational"" when it comes to animals.  For instance, dolphins have been observed having sex with each other, and the same is true for some other marine mammals. However, there is no evidence that dolphins engage in sex for pleasure, and that sex is not a ""reward"" for them.  That said, dolphins are known to have complex social structures, and social behavior can be an important part of their survival.",1,0.316,and the same is true for some other marine mammals,"and that sex is not a ""reward"" for them"
Why are the times of ocean tides so different between relatively nearby areas?,"The times of tides are determined by the moon and the sun. The moon and the sun are both gravitationally attracted to the Earth, and their gravitational fields pull on the Earth's oceans. The moon's gravitational field is stronger than the sun's, so the moon's pull is stronger on the oceans. This causes the tides to rise and fall.

Do most move production companies have back up plans if a main character's actor dies?,"The answer is ""it depends"".  For example, if the actor dies in a scene where they are supposed to be dead, it's probably a lot easier to just replace the actor. It's not as hard as it would be if they were a character in a different scene, because the actor isn't needed for the rest of the scene.

Does cooking meat change the shelf life?,"Cooking meat does not change its shelf life. It changes the way it is stored. When meat is cooked, it is cooked to a point where it can no longer be safely stored in the same conditions as raw meat. This is because cooking meat destroys bacteria that can cause food poisoning. So, you can safely store cooked meat in the refrigerator.

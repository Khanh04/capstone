        "Answer:\n",
        " I have an unpublished paper on this subject that sheds some light. I will summarize:  We have some interesting demographic data from the early 14th century in China showing the outbreak of various epidemics. These were very significant, and were certainly contributing factors to the demise of the Yuen dynasty. I say various because it is unclear from the documents whether the outbreaks were the same disease. Many of the surviving documents are brief, reporting only deaths.  So, we cannot say definitively whether the black death existed in China or not, but there was/were disease(s) at the right time, and it/they knocked out a significant chunk of the population.  EDIT: I realize this is ambiguous - the paper is not mine, my thesis advisor from grad school wrote it.\n",

        "The term \"Black Death\" is often mentioned in Western history, but not in Chinese history, despite the fact that the plague originated in China around 7th century AD. There are several reasons for this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chinese records**: The Chinese have a long and detailed record of the plague, which dates back to the 7th century AD. The Chinese historian Sun Tzu wrote about the plague in his book \"The Art of War,\" which is a historical treatise on military strategy and tactics. The Chinese also kept records of the plague for many centuries, which provide valuable information about its spread and impact.\n",
        "2. **More detailed records**: The Chinese records of the plague are more detailed and comprehensive than those of the Western world. The Chinese records describe the plague as a major public health crisis, with widespread outbreaks, epidemics, and even the deaths of millions of people. The Chinese also kept records of the plague's spread, including maps of the affected areas and descriptions of the disease's symptoms.\n",
        "3. **Early European records**: While the Chinese have a long record of the plague, the first European records of the disease were not until the 12th century AD. These early European records were based on the accounts of Christian missionaries and travelers, who had visited the plague-ridden regions of the Middle East and Asia. The European accounts of the plague were often sensationalized and exaggerated, which further solidified the \"Black Death\" label.\n",
        "4. **Medieval European literature**: The \"Black Death\" was also perpetuated by medieval European literature, particularly in the works of medieval scholars and theologians. These writers often used the plague as a metaphor for the corrupting influence of sin and the dangers of unchecked power and corruption.\n",
        "5. **Historical narrative**: The narrative of the \"Black Death\" has been shaped by Western historical narratives, which often focus on the horrors of war, disease, and death. The \"Black Death\" has been used as a symbol of the horrors of the Middle Ages, and has been invoked to justify the persecution of minority groups, the suppression of dissent, and the persecution of heretics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, Chinese history has been shaped by a different narrative, which emphasizes the importance of social hierarchy, moral values, and the balance of yin and yang. The Chinese have a rich tradition of storytelling and historiography, which often focus on the development of Confucianism, the rise of the Han Dynasty, and the spread of Buddhism.\n",

        "The Black Death is a very famous event in European history. It was a major factor in the rise of the nation-states of Europe. It's not like that in China. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China. It was in Europe, and it's not like that in Asia. The plague didn't have a major impact on the political landscape of China. The plague didn't even make it to China.

        "Answer:\n",
        " How do you sell perfume in a down-to-earth way? \"Buy our perfume! It's better than our competitor because....it smells good!\"  The sole purpose of perfume ad is to create brand awareness instead of being informative like drug ads (our allergy pills are more effective) or car ads (our cars are much safer than their car). Perfume formula don't change from year to year, so they can't say why it's better than the previous year's model. Perfume preference is extremely subjective, so it's hard to say your perfume smells better and explain why. We all know what perfumes do, you can't even do an ad base on that. Their ads are really just there to tell you they exist. You can't visually see the product being used, so they are usually trying to show either an idealized consumer of their product (use our perfume and you can be like her!) or the imaginary effect of their products (use our perfume and get laid!). When you try to convey an abstract idea, it's best to act it out rather than describe it with words.\n",

        "5. **Marketing strategy**: Advertisements for perfumes and colognes often use a combination of psychological and behavioral techniques to influence the viewer's purchasing decisions. Unusual imagery may be used to create a sense of intrigue, curiosity, or even fear (e.g., the \"fear of not smelling your perfume\").\n",
        "6. **Brand identity**: Perfumes and colognes often have unique brand identities that are reflected in their advertising. Unusual imagery may be used to convey the brand's personality, values, or values.\n",

        "Lie detectors, also known as polygraph tests or truth-in-adjudication tests, are devices used to measure physiological responses, such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as behavioral responses, like brain waves, when a person is under stress or deception.\n",
        "\n",
        "While lie detectors have been used in various contexts, including law enforcement, they do not work as a foolproof method to detect deception. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Limited accuracy**: Lie detectors are not 100% accurate. They can detect deception, but not everyone who is lying will respond to the test. This is known as the \"false positive rate.\"\n",
        "2. **Context-dependent**: Lie detectors measure physiological responses, but they do not capture the full context of a person's behavior. For example, a person may be lying about their financial situation, but also about their relationship or health.\n",
        "3. **Variability**: Physiological responses can vary greatly from person to person, even when they are under stress or deception. This means that a lie detector may not detect deception in someone who is not trying to deceive.\n",
        "4. **No foolproof method**: Lie detectors are not a reliable way to detect deception. In fact, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that lie detectors are not an effective method for detecting deception.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled that polygraph tests are not a reliable method for detecting deception. The court found that lie detectors are not reliable because they can be influenced by various factors, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reactivity**: A person's physiological responses can be influenced by their emotional state, which can affect the accuracy of the test.\n",
        "- **Context**: The test is only as accurate as the context in which it is administered.\n",
        "- **Psychological factors**: A person's past experiences, personality traits, and cognitive biases can affect their test results.\n",

        "1. **Low oxygen levels**: The high atmosphere has very little oxygen (less than 10%) compared to the Earth's surface. Combustion reactions require oxygen to sustain them.\n",
        "2. **High temperatures**: The high atmosphere is extremely hot, with temperatures ranging from -89°C to 120°C (−130°F to 248°F). This makes combustion reactions difficult to initiate and sustain.\n",
        "3. **Low pressure**: The high atmosphere has very low pressure, which makes it challenging for gases to mix and react.\n",

        "1. **Lint is not actually lint**: While it's true that the lint is a byproduct of the drying process, it's not actually lint. In fact, lint is the soft, fluffy fibers that are shed from clothing, towels, and other fabrics. These fibers can be quite fine and can easily become airborne.\n",

        "3. **Lint trap design**: The design of the lint trap can also contribute to lint accumulation. If the trap is not designed to catch lint, it can accumulate in the dryer and cause problems.\n",
        "4. **Drying cycle duration**: If the dryer is running for too long, it can cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly loaded or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.\n",

        " Short answer, yes. The stuff in the food that we can smell enters the air more easily when warm.  The real answer is that aromatic compounds are more volatile at higher temperatures.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "When food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds into the air. These compounds are the molecules that give us the smell of food. Here's why we can smell food more easily when it's hot:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs):** When food is hot, the Maillard reaction occurs, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is cooked. This reaction produces more VOCs, which are the molecules responsible for our sense of smell.\n",
        "2. **Enhanced volatile emissions:** Hot food releases more VOCs into the air, making the scent of the food more intense and pronounced.\n",
        "3. **Increased aldehyde release:** Aldehydes are a type of VOC that is released when food is heated. They are responsible for the characteristic \"aromatic\" or \"fatty\" smell of cooked foods.\n",
        "4. **Smell of the cooking process:** When food is hot, it can also release the smell of the cooking process, such as the aroma of butter or oil. These smells can be more intense when food is hot, making the food more appetizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, when food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds, which are responsible for our sense of smell. This is why we can smell food more easily when it's hot, and why cooking food can be such a sensory experience.<|eot_id|>\n",

When you smell something, it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules. When the molecules are hot, they are moving around more quickly, so your nose can detect them more easily.  The hot food is also more volatile, so it's more likely that it will be able to escape your nose and into your lungs.

        " There's a famous unidentified body from 19th century Paris--a beautiful young woman known only as \"L'inconnue de la Seine\" (the unknown of the Seine River). Her body was recovered and the mortician made a face mask of her so that she could be identified more easily--looking at a mask is a lot more appealing than looking at a rotting dead body. Because of her beauty, she drew a lot of attention, but in some other cases, they also did molds of the face. Once photography was available, photos might be taken of the unidentified after they were buried. In this case, though, she was never identified, but her face became a popular work of art, and the Resuscitation doll used in Red Cross classes on CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, now has her face.\n",

        "Economists' reaction to Reagan's Trickle-Down Economics Tax Plan was overwhelmingly negative. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan introduced a tax plan that aimed to reduce income inequality by lowering tax rates on the wealthy. However, economists and experts at the time strongly criticized this plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plan was based on the idea that by reducing tax rates on the wealthy, the money they created would trickle down to the rest of society, thereby reducing income inequality. However, this idea was later discredited by economists.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main criticisms of the plan was that it would not actually reduce income inequality. In fact, the wealthy would continue to accumulate wealth and power, while the poor and middle class would be left with lower tax rates. This was because the wealthy would be able to shift their wealth from the stock market and other investments to their tax returns, thereby reducing their tax liability.\n",

        "- Reducing the purchasing power of the poor and middle class.\n",
        "- Encouraging investment in speculative assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than productive capital.\n",

        "The economists' concerns were further highlighted by the 1981 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, which estimated that the plan would lead to a significant increase in income inequality.

I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing.  So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead.  The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.<|eot_id|>\n",

        " The Battle of Tours is widely touted, along with Salamis, as a *battle that saved western civilization.*  This really is not the case. I've phrased it this way on this subreddit before, but the Umayyad war machine was grinding to a halt by the time armies crossed the Pyrenees. Supply lines were massive, especially for an empire stretching from Transoxiana to the Iberian Peninsula. Also, keep in mind that this Arab army was most likely a raiding force out pillaging Aquitaine rather than a force bent on conquest. Coupled with that, a few years following the Battle of Tours there was an Umayyad disaster in North Africa. The Berber Revolt of 740 crippled imperial authority in North Africa and several independent Islamic Berber states rose. The Umayyads suffered a humiliating defeat and couldn't focus on foreign conquest. So, realistically, had the Umayyads emerged victorious from Tours, they probably wouldn't have been able to follow up the victory.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an intriguing one, but unfortunately, it's based on a historical event that never occurred. Charles Martel, also known as Charles Martel the Great, was a Frankish king who fought against the Moors in the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. This battle was a significant victory for the Franks, but it was not a decisive one.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if we consider the possibility of an Umayyad occupation of France, we need to examine the historical context and the Umayyad Empire's expansion plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Umayyad Caliphate was a powerful Islamic state that emerged in the 7th century AD. They were a major power in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain, and their empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The Umayyads were Sunni Muslims who sought to spread Islam to the non-Muslim populations of their territories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the historical context, it's unlikely that the Umayyads would have had a significant occupation of France. France was already a Roman province, and the Roman Empire had been conquered by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD. The Umayyads, being a Muslim empire, would not have had the same level of control over the Western Mediterranean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the Umayyads' expansion plans were focused on the Mediterranean region, Africa, and the Middle East. They did have some influence in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), but it was limited to the kingdoms of Toledo and the Kingdom of Asturias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the historical context, it's highly unlikely that an Umayyad occupation of France would have been successful. The Umayyads would not have had the same level of military power, technological advancements, or strategic alliances as the Franks, and their empire's expansion plans would not have extended to the Western Mediterranean.\n",

        "In conclusion, while the idea of an Umayyad occupation of France is an interesting one, it's based on a historical event that never occurred.

        "Answer:\n",
        " Your metabolism slows by about 10% while you are asleep (and body heat is a byproduct of metabolism). Your core temperature actually drops by a degree or two. Most people are in the 96° range while they sleep.  Your brain's \"thermostat\" (the hypothalamus) is set to 98.6 or so, so when you wake up, your brain thinks, \"Woah! Chilly! We prefer to keep it a little warmer in here!\" Then you start shivering and moving around (or you crawl under the covers) and warm up!\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reasons why you might feel hotter trying to sleep than trying to wake up, regardless of the actual room temperature. Here are some possible explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Body heat:** When you're trying to sleep, your body is in a state of dormancy, and your metabolism slows down. This means that your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer. Conversely, when you're trying to wake up, your body is in a state of wakefulness, and it's more efficient at generating heat to warm you up.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Metabolic rate:** As mentioned earlier, when you're trying to sleep, your body's metabolic rate slows down, which means it uses less energy. This reduced metabolic rate can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sweating and evaporation:** When you're trying to sleep, your body produces more sweat, which can evaporate quickly, making you feel warmer. This process is more efficient when it's cooler, as the air is already cooled.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Adaptation to temperature:** Your body has an internal thermostat that regulates its temperature. When you're trying to sleep, this thermostat is set to a lower temperature, making you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hormonal changes:** Sleep and wakefulness are regulated by hormones, such as melatonin and cortisol. During sleep, melatonin levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer. During wakefulness, cortisol levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Comfort and relaxation:** When you're trying to sleep, it's often a comfortable and relaxing environment. This comfort can make you feel warmer, as your body is in a state of relaxation.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Evaporative cooling:** When you're trying to sleep, the air is often more still, which means it's easier for the air to evaporate and cool the body. This process is more efficient when it's cooler.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Psychological factors:** Your perception of temperature can be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, boredom, or excitement. If you're trying to sleep, you may feel more relaxed and comfortable, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Sleep stage:** When you're trying to sleep, you're likely in a deep sleep stage, which means your body is in a state of dormancy. During deep sleep, your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Individual variability:** Everyone's body is different, and individual variability can affect how you perceive temperature. Some people may\n",

When you wake up, the air you breathe is no longer shielded from the heat of the room, and your body has to work to cool you down. When you are hot, you can't cool down very well, so you feel like you are burning. When you are cold, you can cool down very well, so you feel like you are warm. So when you wake up, you feel like you are burning, because you can't cool down as well as you did when you were sleeping.<|eot_id|>\n",

This is mainly a thing for spinning black holes, although the gravitational effects of the Earth's rotation has been measured by a very precise satellite experiment called [Gravity Probe B](_URL_0_).

        "In other words, while angular momentum can generate a gravitational effect, it's not the same as saying that gravity is a result of an object's angular momentum.

This led to the evolution of a highly sensitive olfactory system. Over time, our brains became attuned to detect even the faintest of smells, making us more sensitive to odors.\n",
        "2. **Olfactory receptors**: Our noses contain specialized cells called olfactory receptors, which bind to odor molecules and trigger a response in the brain. These receptors are highly sensitive to certain smells, allowing us to detect even the smallest amounts.\n",
        "3. **Brain processing**: When we detect an odor, our brains process it quickly and send signals to the brain's reward centers, which release dopamine and other neurotransmitters. This creates a strong association between the odor and the experience of pleasure, which can make us more sensitive to odors.\n",
        "4. **Conditioned response**: Our brains have learned to associate certain smells with specific events, such as food, hygiene, or stress. This is known as a conditioned response. When we smell something unpleasant, our brains recall the experience of smelling something unpleasant in the past and link it to the current odor.\n",
        "5. **Neurotransmitters**: The release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, plays a crucial role in our response to odors. These chemicals help regulate the intensity and duration of our response to odors.\n",

        "Animals, on the other hand, have a different olfactory system that is less sensitive and less complex. They do not have the same level of olfactory receptors or the same brain processing mechanisms as humans. As a result, they are less sensitive to odors and do not get grossed out by the same smells.\n",

        "* **Smell threshold**: Animals have a higher smell threshold than humans, meaning they can detect even fainter smells.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " To the average person, you might see your rates go up a slight bit, or banks might be less willing to create new loans. On a broad scale, the Federal Reserve loans money out to the big banks, who in turn loan it out to smaller banks, businesses, and people.  By raising the interest rate, the Fed is making it more expensive to borrow money from them.\n",

And since you've got a motor, you can move quite a bit faster than on foot, so you'll want to have a group of these shield-vehicles moving together. And since a motorized shield-vehicle can carry so much more weight, you could have the soldiers use guns that are far larger and heavier than their normal guns.

        "Answer:\n",
        " Assuming the bubbles are short lived they are just coming from the [aerator](_URL_0_) on your tap which is designed to disrupt the flow of water and introduce a bunch of air into the stream. When filling something slowly you give that extra air plenty of time to spread out and escape but when filling a narrow vessel quickly you continuously trap more and more of that air which will build up as bubbles on the surface. Assuming it is just normal tap water the bubbles should be relatively short lived, but if there is some kind of surfactant in the water then it can stabilize the bubbles for long periods of time. If you want to avoid this you can use a faucet without an aerator which should eliminate most of that inconvenience. However, aerators are generally included on household faucets as they can significantly reduce water usage so consider that before removing yours for this purpose.\n",

        "1. **Mineral buildup**: Tap water often contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium. When these minerals enter the water supply, they can precipitate out of the water and form scales on the inside of the pipes. Over time, this can lead to excessive bubbling when filling a water bottle.\n",
        "2. **Hard water**: Hard water is water that contains high levels of minerals, which can cause it to bubble up when exposed to air.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Radiative Energy**: The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas (plasma) at its core. This hot gas is in constant motion, with kinetic energy and thermal energy. As this energy is released, it becomes a form of electromagnetic radiation.\n",
        "2. **Blackbody Radiation**: This radiation is a form of blackbody radiation, where all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are emitted. Blackbody radiation is a characteristic of objects at high temperatures, like the Sun.\n",
        "3. **Wavelength Distribution**: The wavelength distribution of the radiation emitted by the Sun is not uniform across all frequencies. It is actually a continuous spectrum, with all wavelengths present.\n",
        "4. **Frequency Distribution**: As the radiation is emitted, it spreads out in all directions, creating a spherical distribution of radiation. This is because the radiation is emitted from a sphere (the Sun) and spreads out in all directions.\n",

        "The reason for this directional emission is due to the way the radiation interacts with the surrounding medium (air, space, etc.). The radiation is affected by the medium's density, temperature, and composition, which causes it to bend and scatter in different ways. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh.\n",

The software will then take a new image and compare it to the old image. If the new image is the same size and shape as the old image, the software will use the old image and replace the parts that were replaced. If the new image is smaller, the software will use the new image and remove parts of the old image. If the new image is larger, the software will use the new image and add parts to the old image. This is why the software will sometimes make the image look blurry or distorted.

Dailies tend to be a disposable material with as little \"tech\" in them as necessary since you're going to throw them away anyway. Monthlies and longer tend to have tech to allow them to \"breathe\" allowing oxygen and other things your eye would naturally be exposed to, to reach it. How much of this \"breathing ability\" is marketing jargon, I don't know.   One thing I'm sure of though is that the main cause of eye irritation over time that is brought on by contact lenses is protein/scum buildup on the contact surface. People who have low tolerance for this usually end up using dailies.  People with higher tolerance can use the longer wear lenses. There is technology (materials) that allow lenses to be more resistant to this plaque buildup, which is typically used in longer-wear lenses for obvious reasons, and this might very well be the area where the different cost is reflected\n",

Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for centuries, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been living in the Amazon for over 20,000 years. This long history of human presence has allowed for the development of complex societies, including the indigenous communities that still live in the Amazon today.\n",

        "1. **Mortality rate**: Diseases with high mortality rates, such as smallpox, are more likely to be contracted only once.

They have a readily available supply of water in the form of what they bring from Earth, plus what they can save from their waste material (and yes that includes feces) and what the ISS can save from the humidity in the air.  A bit of this water is then processed through electrolysis and separated into Hydrogen and Oxygen. I...

        "2. **Oxygen Storage**: The oxygen generated by the generators is stored in tanks or containers, which are then transported to the space station.\n",
        "3. **Oxygen Distribution**: The oxygen is distributed to the space station's living quarters, life support systems, and other areas through a network of pipes and tubes. The oxygen is released into the air through valves and nozzles.\n",
        "4. **Oxygen Recycling**: The space station has a closed-loop life support system, where the air is recycled and reused. The oxygen-rich air is vented out into space, while the nitrogen and other gases are collected and stored for later use.\n",
        "5. **Oxygen Concentrators**: Some space stations have oxygen concentrators, which use a process called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove carbon dioxide and other gases from the air. This process recovers the oxygen and releases the other gases.\n",

In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more. In cold weather, the air is much drier, which is why it smells so much more.  In the case of the nose, cold air is more dense than warm air, so it's more likely that the cold air is carrying more particles (like dust, pollen, etc.) into the nostrils.

Only some of the energy bound up in food is utilized by your body, and **none** of it comes from converting mass into energy. Your body takes chemical potential energy from bonds between atoms in your food and (after generally storing that energy in different chemical bonds) utilizes it to drive all the processes that keep you alive. Much of the actual mass of the food is used as raw material to make structures your body needs like new cells etc. Some of that material is used wholesale because your body can't produce it on its own (like vitamins).

Since space is essentially empty, all the sunlight streaming through it just flies off in straight lines away from the sun forever. You could only see it if there were something for it to bounce off ... like the moon or the planets.\n",

        "On Earth, the atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions, making it seem brighter than it actually is. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and infrared, which is why the sky appears blue.\n",
        "\n",
        "In space, the atmosphere is missing, so there's no scattering of sunlight. As a result, the light that reaches our planet's surface is essentially reflected back, giving us the appearance of sunlight.\n",
        "\n",
        "This difference in light behavior is also why the Sun appears to be brighter in the sky than it actually is. The Sun's light is not scattered in all directions; it's mostly reflected back to Earth, which is why we see it as a bright star.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the lack of atmosphere in space means that there's no greenhouse effect to retain heat and warm the planet. Without this effect, the temperature on Earth would be much colder, and the Sun would not appear as bright.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that there are some regions in space where there is still some atmosphere, such as the magnetosphere around the Moon or the exosphere of other planets. However, these are not as significant an effect as the lack of atmosphere on Earth.\n",

The reason for this is because a cat's body is designed to be smaller. It has to be because it's a predator. It has to be smaller than the dogs that it will be hunting. So it has evolved to be smaller. It's the same reason why humans evolved to be smaller than lions. It's not because humans are smaller than lions.

        "Answer:\n",
        " \\They don't do it because they don't see the point. The real power in NATO comes from the US, so as long as the Americans keep up the spending, they're still golden. Not to mention, since the end of World War II, Germany has generally had a rather pronounced anti-war stance, so having a large army isn't exactly a popular choice. That said, it's not really fair to make fun of Germany in this regard. NATO has, what, 28 member states, and only about 5 which meet the 2% minimum. NATO is already *significantly* more powerful than any other military force on the planet, so it's kind of hard for most countries to justify ramping up military spending they'll never actually use, when they could instead put that money into social services.\n",

        "Germany's reluctance to increase its military spending and size is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Here are some key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Economic constraints**: Germany is a member of the European Union, and the EU's economic policies, such as the Single Market and the Eurozone, have led to significant budgetary constraints. Germany's defense spending is a small fraction of its GDP, and increasing it would require significant increases in taxation or other means.\n",
        "2. **Historical and cultural factors**: Germany's military history is marked by significant defeats, particularly during World War II. This has led to a cultural aversion to military spending, and many Germans believe that a strong military is not necessary or desirable.\n",
        "3. **Fear of nuclear war**: Germany's experience with nuclear war during the Cold War has led to a lingering fear of nuclear conflict. This fear has contributed to a reluctance to increase military spending.\n",
        "4. **Comparison to other NATO member states**: Germany is often compared to other NATO member states, such as the United Kingdom and France, which have larger militaries. This comparison can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",
        "5. **Lack of a clear defense strategy**: Germany has not developed a clear and concise defense strategy, which is essential for NATO member states. This lack of strategy can make it difficult to justify increased military spending.\n",
        "6. **Bureaucratic and institutional factors**: Germany's military bureaucracy is complex, and changes to military structures and procedures can be slow and difficult to implement. This can make it challenging to increase military spending.\n",
        "7. **Focus on economic growth**: Germany's economic growth strategy, known as the \"European Economic Area\" (EEA) and the \"Schengen Area,\" prioritizes economic growth and integration over military spending.\n",
        "8. **EU budget allocation**: Germany's contributions to the EU budget are significant, but the allocation of funds to other areas, such as defense, is limited. This can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",

So they've been spending more than they would have had to on their own military, and they're not done yet.  The problem is that the German government is still pretty conservative. They don't want to spend more on their military, because they think it's a waste of money. They're also concerned about the size of the US military.

        "Answer:\n",
        " By some measures, outlawing of popular recreational drugs results in considerably more societal ills than if we just regulated and taxed them. Because drugs are illegal, they are used to fund organized crime all over the world; they force partakers to get involved with shady people; they are not sufficiently researched for their effects on human health; they are not regulated, so people end up buying and injecting all kinds of horrendously danger chemicals; they continue to fuel the very expensive and very ineffective \"war on drugs\", which results in prisons full of people who've committed non-violent, victim-less crimes.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Reducing Overdoses and Deaths**: One of the most pressing concerns surrounding illicit substances is the high rate of overdose deaths. By legalizing and regulating the sale of these substances, the risk of overdose and death could be significantly reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Regulation and Safety**: Regulating the sale and distribution of substances could make them safer for users. This could involve strict quality control measures, secure packaging, and secure storage.\n",

        "5. **Abolishing the Black Market**: The black market for illicit substances is a major driver of organized crime and violence. By legalizing all drugs, the black market could be abolished, reducing violence and exploitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Personal Freedom**: Advocates of legalization argue that individuals should be free to make their own choices about the substances they consume. This includes the choice to use or not use substances, including prescription medications.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Scientific Research**: With the legalization of all drugs, scientists could focus on studying the therapeutic potential of substances rather than their potential risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Reducing Police Power**: The war on drugs has led to a significant increase in police power, which has contributed to mass incarceration and racial disparities in the justice system. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from policing to public health.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Addressing Socioeconomic Inequality**: The war on drugs disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from addressing socioeconomic inequality to providing equitable access to healthcare and treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Global Perspective**: Many countries have chosen to legalize or decriminalize certain substances, such as cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamine. This global trend suggests that there is a shift towards a more permissive approach to substance use.\n",

        " You can't look at Benham's disk on a monitor and know what color you \"would\" see on the real thing, ironically enough for almost the exact same reason we see color there in the first place. With a real-world disk, we see colors because some of our eye's receptors fire faster or linger longer than others - So a rapid white/black transition favors whatever receptors send the strongest signal back to the brain. Think of it like a poll - \"Hey red, what do you see?\" \"Umm, something, I guess...\" \"Blue? What about you?\" \"Yeah, something bluish\" \"Green?\" \"YES, oh wow, yes, dude, you have to see this, so greenly awesome, hey can we stop at Taco Bell later?\". Going back to monitors, you can't (necessarily) see the right color because it will depend less on your eye and more on which color of subpixels in your monitor has the longest retain time - Frequently red, for LCDs.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.\n",
        "2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the \"optical passband.\" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.\n",
        "3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the \"color gamut.\" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.\n",
        "4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>\n",

The problem is that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the distance between the Earth and the object can vary, so the parallax method only works for very far away objects. The most precise way to measure the distance is to use the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is a number that tells you how fast the universe is expanding.

        " Crossbow bolts are thicker, heavier, and shorter, and crossbows have shorter strings, compared to arrows and bows. This makes them less aerodynamic and reduces the amount of maximum potential imparted by the weapon.  The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here.

        "3. **String Tension**: Bows have a lighter string tension, which means the string is not stretched out as far as it would be on a crossbow. This reduced string tension affects the range and accuracy of the bow.\n",
        "4. **Projectile Speed**: Crossbows can fire projectiles at higher speeds (up to 300 feet per second or 90 meters per second) than bows (around 100-150 feet per second). This increased speed results in a longer range.\n",
        "5. **Projectile Mass**: Crossbows typically fire heavier projectiles (around 100-150 grains) than bows (around 20-50 grains). The heavier projectile affects the range and accuracy of the crossbow.\n",
        "6. **Caliber**: Crossbows often have a higher caliber (e.g.,.22 or.25) than bows (e.g.,.22 or.30). A higher caliber results in a longer range, but also increases the risk of over-penetration.\n",

A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot.

        " Ignoring air resistance, the forces on the balloon are gravity and buoyancy.   F = rho_air * V_balloon * g - m_balloon * g where rho is a density, and g is the gravitational acceleration. We can also write    V_balloon = m_balloon / rho_balloon so   F = m_balloon*g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) Newton II says F = ma so   a_balloon = g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) in other words, the balloon acceleration upwards depends on the ratio of densities of the surrounding air to the balloon contents. It will have an acceleration upwards equal to g if and only if rho_air/rho_balloon = 2 -- if the balloon is half as dense as the surrounding air. This is also ignoring any expansion or compression of the balloon as the outside pressure changes.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "If it weren't for air resistance, balloons would indeed rise with the same acceleration as gravity. This is because air resistance is a force that opposes the motion of an object, such as a balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a balloon is inflated and rises into the air, it is essentially in a state of free fall, with an acceleration of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s^2) due to gravity. However, air resistance acts in the opposite direction, trying to slow down the balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "If there were no air resistance, the balloon would continue to rise at the same rate as it would if it were in a vacuum. This is because the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object, so even if the velocity is the same, the force is reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if there were no air resistance, the balloon would rise with the same acceleration as gravity, but it would also rise at a much faster rate than it would if it were in a vacuum. This is why balloons often float gently to the ground, rather than falling quickly to the surface.\n",

        "I can answer this question for you, but I don't want to give you the wrong answer. If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls. So it is the difference in the direction of the air that makes the balloon fall, not the difference in the air's density.<|eot_id|>\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " _URL_0_ Thermal energy is really just the atoms in a material jiggling. The more you heat something up the more the atoms jiggle back and forth. In a gas or liquid, the atoms can move freely bouncing around off of each other, while in a solid that atoms jiggle back and forth in place. When you rub or hit two objects together some of the kinetic energy of the movement is converted into more jiggling of the atoms in each material. Blacksmiths can get a small thin piece of metal red hot just by hammering it with a big hammer. If you bounce a ball on a hard surface in a vacuum, it eventually stops bouncing. The kinetic energy of the ball isn't gone, if you could measure the temperature of the ball and floor before and after very accurately, you'd find that they are both slightly warmer.\n",

        "Friction creates heat through a process called thermal friction, also known as friction heating or friction-induced heat transfer. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Surface Contact**: When two surfaces come into contact, they transfer energy through friction.\n",
        "2. **Frictional Force**: The frictional force is generated by the interaction between the two surfaces. This force is proportional to the normal force (N) between the surfaces and the coefficient of friction (μ) between them.\n",
        "3. **Heat Generation**: As the frictional force increases, it generates heat due to the following mechanisms:\n",
        "\t* **Conduction**: Heat is transferred through conduction, where the kinetic energy of the particles is transferred from one location to another.\n",
        "\t* **Convection**: Heat is also transferred through convection, where the heated particles move and transfer heat to the surrounding air.\n",
        "\t* **Radiation**: Heat is also transferred through radiation, where the heated particles emit radiation energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Frictional Heat Transfer Mechanisms**:\n",

        "There are several mechanisms that contribute to frictional heat transfer:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Sticky Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles on the surfaces to stick together, creating a \"sticky\" frictional force.\n",
        "* **Adhesive Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the adhesive force between them can also cause the particles to stick together, generating heat.\n",
        "* **Viscous Friction**: When two surfaces are in contact, the frictional force can cause the particles to stick together, creating a viscous frictional force.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Heat Generation Rate**: The heat generation rate is influenced by the frictional force, which is proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of friction. The heat generation rate is typically highest at the point of contact and decreases as the frictional force decreases.\n",

        "In summary, friction creates heat through the generation of frictional force, which generates heat through various mechanisms, including conduction, convection, radiation, and adhesive friction.

        " Intellectual disability - basically I'm not smart enough. Learning disability - I can't learn via specific processes. Often characterized by senses I.e. auditory processing disorder. You can't learn something by hearing instructions, but given picture instructions it's easy to learn the same thing.  If a cup represents your ability to learn, a really small cup is an intellectual disability. A cup with a lid that has circular holes means the cup can only be filled a certain way (or certain ways, really).\n",

        "The main differences between a learning disability and an intellectual disability are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definition:** Learning disabilities are a group of conditions that affect an individual's ability to learn and understand, while intellectual disabilities are a broader category of conditions that affect cognitive functioning, including learning, memory, and problem-solving.\n",

        "4. **Sound Distortion**: Some 3D movies can cause sound distortion, which can be disorienting and lead to headaches.\n",
        "5. **Sensitivity to Light**: The bright lights used in 3D movies can cause sensitivity to light, leading to headaches in some individuals.\n",
        "6. **Motion Paralysis**: This is a rare condition where the brain and muscles become paralyzed due to prolonged exposure to 3D movies, leading to headaches.\n",

        "2. **Genetics**: Skin color is determined by the amount and distribution of melanin in the skin. People with darker skin colors have more melanin in their skin, which gives them a darker hue.\n",
        "3. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to sunlight can cause melanin production to increase, resulting in darker skin colors. This is why people from tropical regions often have darker skin colors.\n",
        "4. **Evolutionary History**: The distribution of melanin in the skin is also influenced by an individual's evolutionary history. People from regions with high levels of melanin production, such as the Amazon rainforest, have more melanin in their skin, resulting in darker skin colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the variation in skin colors across different populations. Here's a rough breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dark Skin**: People from tropical regions, such as those in Africa, Asia, and Indigenous Australia, often have darker skin colors due to high levels of melanin production.\n",
        "- **Medium Skin**: People from temperate regions, such as those in Europe, North America, and parts of Australia, typically have medium skin colors due to moderate levels of melanin production.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Early beginnings:** Girl Scout cookies were first introduced in 1917 by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The first recipe was a simple chocolate chip cookie made with just a few ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and chocolate chips.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quality over quantity:** Over the years, the Girl Scouts refined their cookie recipe, focusing on quality ingredients and careful baking. They used high-quality chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract to create a rich, delicious flavor.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quality control:** To ensure consistency and quality, the Girl Scouts developed a strict quality control process. They tested their cookies in small batches, using only the finest ingredients and a rigorous testing protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "**No shortcuts:** Unlike some other cookie manufacturers, the Girl Scouts didn't rely on shortcuts or preservatives to extend shelf life. Their cookies were baked fresh daily, using traditional baking methods that preserved the natural flavors and textures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attention to detail:** The Girl Scouts are known for their attention to detail, from the packaging to the branding. Their iconic brown paper bags, colorful labels, and \"Treat of the Month\" promotions have become synonymous with the brand.\n",

        "1. **Overemphasis on quantity over quality:** Companies often prioritize mass production over quality ingredients and careful baking. This can result in cookies that are bland, overly sweet, or lacking in flavor.\n",
        "2. **Lack of transparency:** Companies may not disclose the exact ingredients or manufacturing processes used in their cookies. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for consumers to trust the product.\n",
        "3. **Preservatives and additives:** Some companies may use preservatives or additives to extend shelf life, which can affect the natural flavor and texture of the cookie.\n",
        "4. **Shortcuts and automation:** Companies may rely on automated production lines or shortcuts to save time and money, which can result in cookies that are inconsistent or lacking in quality.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        " Assuming no atmosphere, the force it takes to launch from the surface would be equal to the force of collision with the surface upon landing. So the gravity of the planet doesn't matter - the question of whether you can injure yourself is dependent solely on the force you can exert with your legs.\n",
        "Baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "On a lower gravity planet, the concept of \"jumping\" might be different from what we're used to on Earth. The lower gravity would likely affect the trajectory and landing of an object or person.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a lower gravity environment, objects would experience a greater downward acceleration, which means they would fall faster and cover more distance in a given time. This could result in a higher impact upon landing.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the severity of an impact would still depend on various factors, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Object size and shape**: A larger, irregularly shaped object would be more likely to cause significant damage upon landing. A smaller, spherical object would be less likely to cause significant damage.\n",
        "2. **Object velocity**: The higher the object's velocity upon impact, the more severe the damage would be.\n",
        "3. **Landing surface**: The type of surface the object lands on would affect the impact. A hard surface would be more likely to cause severe damage than a soft surface.\n",
        "4. **Gravity**: Even on a lower gravity planet, the gravitational force would still be present. However, the reduced gravity might make it more challenging to control the object's descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these factors, it's likely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment. However, the severity of the impact would still depend on the specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate this, consider the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "* If an object were to land on a hard surface in a lower gravity environment, it could be severely injured due to the rapid deceleration upon impact.\n",
        "* If an object were to land on a soft surface, such as a thick layer of foam or a large, soft-bodied creature, it might be less likely to cause significant damage.\n",
        "* If an object were to land in a very low gravity environment, such as on a moon or a planet with a very low surface gravity, the object might be able to cover more distance in a given time, leading to a higher impact upon landing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the lower gravity environment would likely result in a higher impact upon landing, the severity of the impact would still depend on various factors. It's unlikely that objects could be injured upon landing in a lower gravity environment, but the impact would still be significant.<|eot_id|>\n",

But if the gravity is 1/10th that of earth, you could jump 10 times your height and still land with a low velocity, and not be injured.

The HDF is a famous image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Here's why not everyone sees the same colors:\\n\\n1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.\\n2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the \\\"optical passband.\\\" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.\\n3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the \\\"color gamut.\\\" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.\\n4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.\\n\\nIn summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>\",\n          \"Deep-frying a fish involves submerging it in hot oil, which causes the bones and tough parts to become soft and gelatinous. This is because the heat breaks down the connective tissues that hold the bones together, making them more tender and edible.\\n\\nWhen you deep-fry a fish, the following processes occur:\\n\\n1. **Heat denaturation**: The heat from the oil denatures the proteins in the connective tissue, making them more accessible to enzymes.\\n2. **Breakdown of collagen**: The heat breaks down the collagen, a key component of connective tissue, making it less rigid and more tender.\\n3. **Hydrolysis**: The heat also hydrolyzes the proteins, making them more easily broken down and absorbed by the enzymes in the fish.\\n\\nThis process is not unique to deep-frying. Grilling and steaming can also cause the bones and tough parts to become soft, but the mechanism is slightly different.\\n\\nGrilling and steaming cause the heat to break down the proteins in the connective tissue, but they don't necessarily denature the collagen or hydrolyze the proteins as much as deep-frying does.\\n\\nThe reason why deep-frying is more effective at making bones and tough parts edible is that it:\\n\\n* **Leaves more collagen intact**: The heat breaks down some of the collagen, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining collagen and make the bones and tough parts more tender.\\n* **Leaves more connective tissue intact**: The heat also breaks down some of the connective tissue, but it still leaves a significant amount intact. This allows the enzymes to break down the remaining connective tissue and make the bones and tough parts more tender.\\n\\nOverall, the combination of heat denaturation, breakdown of collagen, and hydrolysis makes bones and tough parts more tender and edible when deep-fried.<|eot_id|>\",\n          \"Different foods of the same mass (mass) have different amounts of calories due to variations in their composition. Here's why:\\n\\n1. **Protein content**: Foods with different protein contents have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of lean chicken breast (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 180-200 calories, while a serving of lean beef (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 250-300 calories.\\n2. **Carbohydrate content**: Carbohydrates are a significant source of calories in many foods. Different types of carbohydrates, such as whole grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes, have varying amounts of calories. For instance, a serving of whole grain rice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of starchy vegetable (such as broccoli) contains approximately 50-60 calories.\\n3. **Fat content**: Fats are another important source of calories in many foods. Different types of fats, such as saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of avocado (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 300-400 calories, while a serving of olive oil (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 120-180 calories.\\n4. **Vitamin and mineral content**: Foods with different nutrient profiles have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of vitamin D-fortified milk (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 100-150 calories, while a serving of vitamin D-fortified cereal (around 100-150 grams) contains approximately 50-60 calories.\\n5. **Water content**: Foods with varying water contents have different amounts of calories. For example, a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories, while a serving of dry ice (around 50-60 grams) contains approximately 0-10 calories.\\n\\nTo calculate the calorie content of a specific food, you need to know its composition, which includes its protein, carbohydrate, fat, and water content.

There are many different colors in the disks and they can be very different in appearance. But what i find most interesting about them is that they all look the way they do, and it seems to me that there is a real balance between the different colours and the various properties that make them so different from each other. [re: [post]] reply: well, you just donyou really dont have to think about it as a matter of fact. A lot of people have seen a disk that looks like it had been painted. You just can't see it. For example, if you looked at a normal black disk and you saw that the blackness was not very bad, that would be a pretty good picture. Or you could see a black screen with a red background and a green background. So, even though you can see the screen and there's a nice contrast between them, the contrast is very poor. That is, it doesn't make any difference to the image quality of your computer when you see them in real life.[re-post:] i agree with you. When you read a book about a machine, do you think that it has a good color scheme? If so, then why does it look like a bad one?you know, when i read books, my mind is just like that of an average person. People say that their minds are like this. My mind says, \\\"this is good, this is bad.\\\" but when they look into the computer, they have this bad image, or the bad aspect. They look in to this image and then they think, maybe this picture is better than this one, but it isn't. The computer is like, okay, what is it? That's what they say. And the truth is this computer has this good aspect, which is not good. However, there are people who do this, who think this thing is really good because they see how good it really is. This is what you have. Because they don`t see that, because there aren`ts like these, people are not able to understand what it means. Therefore, in my opinion, a picture like some kind of computer screen is worse than an ordinary picture, to be honest. As far as i can tell, most people see this as the best picture that can stand up to them if they use the right tool. To me, some of them are a bit bit confused. Maybe they just use a different tool, like an old computer monitor. Anyway, while i understand that these things are good things, why do people think they should use this kind, especially for a laptop? To be fair, these are things that i would like to see in computers, where you would have a more accurate understanding of what the difference is between a desktop and an \\\"interpreter\\\" (i. E. The machine that is running the program). In that case, would you prefer the laptop over the desktop? For a long time, we used to say, no, those were bad things. Nowadays, our opinions are different. We have different opinions, for example. Sometimes people say they want a better computer because of this machine. No, sometimes, good people want to use computers that are better. Some people like them because that's their way of doing things and to make money. Others don\\ufffdt like those machines because people dont care about the fact that computers are bad. These things should not be used in such a way. Those are the opinions of those who have never seen this sort of thing, so i have no idea why people would say it was bad or that. Besides, as far, are there any differences in what people use? There is no difference between those two opinions. What is interesting is you are saying that in most computer screens, color is used. Well then, can you show me something like what that means? I want you to show a white screen. On a blue screen, on a yellow screen you might say \\\"what is your view of that?\\\" or it might be \\\"i like white.\\\" you can show them that you want them to look more like blue. Your computer does not have that feature. Instead, your screen uses a combination of white and black. Why do we use that? Because the whites have the opposite effect, whereas the blacks have something more in common with the white. One might wonder, how can we know that a color in a screen can have an effect on the other?\",\n          \"It's not the fish itself, but the way it cooks. It's just a matter of how the meat cooks and how it does so. In the beginning of cooking, the water needs to be boiling to keep it from getting too hot. The water that's still boiling needs a bit more cooking. In addition to that, you'll need to add a little bit of meat or poultry. These meat-skewer recipes are often called deep-frying because they are very simple. They are usually made using a deep fryer or grill. You will also need some other cooking ingredients. Ingredients:- 1 tablespoon olive oil(about 2 cups) - 1 onion, finely choppeddirections: heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Remove from heat and add the garlic and saute until fragrant. If you want to use a separate sauce, add some olive, and stir until combined. Cook for 2 minutes on each side until translucent. Serve immediately. For the cheese: add 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1 1\\u20442 cups water, 2 tablespoons salt, 4 ounces of ground pepper, 3 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt. Put the chicken and cheese in the refrigerator. Let the sauce cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. When the seasonings are completely dissolved, remove from the heat, allow to cool and cut into small pieces. Place the skillet on the center rack. Heat 1 cup (about 1 cups of water) of oil on medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, cover, pour in 2 teaspoons of sauce and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until oil is dissolved and the mixture has a nice, thick consistency. Turn off the burner and allow the liquid to evaporate. Allow to set for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.\",\n          \"The body is always trying to find the right amount of energy for the body to use to maintain its health. The body needs to know if it has enough energy to function properly. The amount it needs is determined by the amount that is consumed in a given day. Therefore, if you have a high energy intake, you will need to consume a lot more calories to get to that energy. Answer: the calories in the diet are the number of foods that are used to make the meal. A low amount will burn more energy than a great amount. So, in order to have the optimal amount, the energy needs must be very high. If you are on a low calorie diet, your body must use as much energy as possible to fuel the metabolism. It is very important to choose the correct amount for your food. For example, one of my favorite foods is bacon. I used it as a breakfast for a long time and have been eating it ever since. But, it seems that the bacon that i am eating has a very low energy content. This is because i have not had bacon for over 5 years. You can read more about my experience at http://www. Fatty-lifestyle. Com/blog/how-to-eat-your-healthy-foods/ . Question: can i eat a different type of food at the end of a meal? Answer: yes. There is no difference in calories, carbs, protein, and fat content between different types of meals. As long as you eat the proper amount each day, there is a good chance that you won't get any extra calories. Also, eating a higher amount does not make you fat. What is the difference between a lower amount and a larger amount? The difference is more important if there are two or more people. When you add in that one person, then the caloric difference from the other person will be larger. In fact, that's why you should use a smaller amount or a whole food like rice or wheat.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GPT2_Finetuned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"~~it's possible to change the frequencies of light that are reflected by the disk.~~ in the case of the red green and blue lights, the frequency of these light waves is a bit different than what you would see in an actual mirror, so it is not possible for your brain to filter out the \\\"correct\\\" frequencies.

Is, \\\"why\\\" is that the \\\"extra calories in foods are more calorie dense? I believe it is more in bulk. Calories. Some foods have more than others, some calories, like pasta. Food. Or foods with a calorie content that have fewer calories may be easier to eat. Not all calories to get. Source: _link_1_ _food_ food in general, no doubt, calories _calories are calories per gram. No matter what you eat, that _is_ calories stored in calories is not. Calorie density, not volume. \\\"calorie density. Nutrition facts and calories_ in grams per serving. All of them are energy content in calorie are not calories burned, volume, kcalories per unit of mass, grams. Weight and weight of calorie. As the saying \\\"further, calorates calories consumed by food _c_ calorie, which is food a food_. Energy, _page_: calories/kcalor food calorie_ (calculation of kcal, weight, mass of weight. Kcal (in calories). Calorie of a measurement of matter. Mass. Of body mass (how much food). _k= mass and energy contained in units of foods _distance from food_. Weight = calories (1 calorie per calorie mass mass - weight or mass) of water per food units, quantity of product of item. Total energy consumed. By volume of material (m) in volume (amount of thing.

            "[Question] Why is the \"Black Death\" mentioned so often in western history but not Chinese history even though it originated there?\n",
            "\n",
            "[Answer] I have an unpublished paper on this subject that sheds some light. I will summarize:  We have some interesting demographic data from the early 14th century in China showing the outbreak of various epidemics. These were very significant, and were certainly contributing factors to the demise of the Yuen dynasty. I say various because it is unclear from the documents whether the outbreaks were the same disease. Many of the surviving documents are brief, reporting only deaths.  So, we cannot say definitively whether the black death existed in China or not, but there was/were disease(s) at the right time, and it/they knocked out a significant chunk of the population.  EDIT: I realize this is ambiguous - the paper is not mine, my thesis advisor from grad school wrote it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Baseline] The term \"Black Death\" is often mentioned in Western history, but not in Chinese history, despite the fact that the plague originated in China around 7th century AD. There are several reasons for this:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Chinese records**: The Chinese have a long and detailed record of the plague, which dates back to the 7th century AD. The Chinese historian Sun Tzu wrote about the plague in his book \"The Art of War,\" which is a historical treatise on military strategy and tactics. The Chinese also kept records of the plague for many centuries, which provide valuable information about its spread and impact.\n",
            "2. **More detailed records**: The Chinese records of the plague are more detailed and comprehensive than those of the Western world. The Chinese records describe the plague as a major public health crisis, with widespread outbreaks, epidemics, and even the deaths of millions of people. The Chinese also kept records of the plague's spread, including maps of the affected areas and descriptions of the disease's symptoms.\n",
            "3. **Early European records**: While the Chinese have a long record of the plague, the first European records of the disease were not until the 12th century AD. These early European records were based on the accounts of Christian missionaries and travelers, who had visited the plague-ridden regions of the Middle East and Asia. The European accounts of the plague were often sensationalized and exaggerated, which further solidified the \"Black Death\" label.\n",
            "4. **Medieval European literature**: The \"Black Death\" was also perpetuated by medieval European literature, particularly in the works of medieval scholars and theologians.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~chinese people didn't kill the black people.~~ in china, the concept of killing the people was a common practice, and the term \"han chu\" refers to killing people that were not actually people of color. However, it is important to note that the phrase \"hangu\" is a contraction of \"china\" and not a \"linguistic chimp\". So it's not really a reference to the chin dynasty, but rather to \"taiwan\" as the name implies. As for why \"the black death\", that's a bit of a loaded question. Is it a term for the same thing as \"dying of old age\", or just a modern term? In some cases, a historical term can be used to describe the death of someone, which is not necessarily the case in others. In other cases it can refer to a specific person, or a particular culture, as well as a general historical concept. This is because it isn't a broad term, per se. But it does give you some insight into the history of the word \"death\", and how it was used in various cultures and societies. For example, you might ask this question in [this thread](_url_0_) if you're interested in more details. Edit: there are also some other posts about the actual \"why the terms \"hun\" in the hangu and \"ang chinyu and han chui, \"shen\" (chin chiang yinglai\" or \"khen\", which are used as historical terms, respectively, not \"white\" of people who died of starvation or old people, by the time, in particular cultures.

The movie was set in the late medieval period, so i think it's safe to assume that it was based around the same time period. It also had a good cast, but i'm not sure how accurate that is. As for why you're asking about the \"last kingdom\" part, there's no particular reason to believe it has any connection to the actual show. Just because something is *based* on the events of the series doesn't mean it doesn *have* any relationship to anything else. And as i understand it, the real answer is that the shows that are based on \"the last king\" are all based off of real events. That means that even if they were based upon real kings, they would still be based entirely on fictional events, and thus they wouldn't be a real show on tv. So you can only answer your question as to whether or not the episodes are *real* episodes, because that would be just as meaningless as asking whether the episode is based in reality.

It would be great to see a real dnb that doesn't get tied into the game like that. (3)i agree onthat one, i feel the tm is not as good as the mnk because of the fact that it gets the most attention, which is good but not great, and the way the nk is based on what it is. (4) (i think it would also be nice if we could actually have a dmba with the kfma and kmk, rather than having it just being a gdt or dlbma. But that's like saying it isn't a game that needs to be played at all. The game is a complex one that requires multiple actions. So it has to really be a part of it. \"i'll show you something special\"-dmitri:d. \"dum-dum\" (d) is an adjective that sounds like a name, meaning \"a person with an interest in music\".—d. M. J. E. D. This is just how i see it: the idea of a \"dna\" is what i like about it, i. E. It doesnt feel like it can be used to refer to something else. Dna refers to people who are interested in something, that is, who want to play dms. In other words, the whole idea is that the person who plays ddm will be the one who is interested and interested about that thing, not just the individual who play it (that is the only way of saying that a person can play dm). In my opinion, its the best way to describe dnd, because it seems to work as a combination of dnd and dnb. If you are playing dm or dng, you would use dns as dnt, dnnt and dntn. Just like in dts, there are no \"special\" ddns. You can still play a ddn if you want, though. And since you can't play any dnnn, then you have to have the dnf (dual d-nn) as well as whatever you do. As for how to use the word dnd, just remember that youll be using the name of your own ddn. Your dd is like your ddn, so if your dda is d, your name is your \"buddy\", and your bdn is its \"brother\", then your brother will have its own dda. Also, if the player is playing a nndd, or any other ddb, their ddd is their \"nnddd\", so you will get a nnddb for your ndd. A ddd will never be considered a bnd. They will also have their own bds, as long as they have that ddb in their dds. Since they donnt have all the information about the bdd, they will just have one ddat (the dty), so they can use their ndds as dts and their bdts as bods. Any dtd that has a bdty will use it as its dta, even if it does not have it in its bdlds (as with dtfd). The ddfd will still be called ddt (which is ddtd) if there is no bdt in it so long. Which is why it could be referred to as \"the ddl\".'dnnntngdnddnnnnn' (dntdn) = dngdnngddddndnn(4.5) ddmntdddndddddnnn (dnnt) - dntddnndndndnim not sure what to make of this, since it sounds almost like ddfd (but thatre like the old name for a fddi) and it might be because the \"nndda\" doesn�t have any name in there.

By releasing the commercial ahead of time, they can mitigate the risk of a negative reaction from fans, critics, or even their own employees.\n",

The poor, the blind and the lame. A new book has been published in the uk that addresses the problem of blind people. A blog post by the writer, mary anne, reveals that blind blind persons can only be represented by their own eyes.2. Blind people are not only stupid. They are also stupid because they can't distinguish between the two. In fact, a blind person cannot distinguish the difference between a person with autism and a child with speech disorders. For example, in one study, blind children were not able to distinguish \"between the words \" and \"fugitive\" in \"the boy and his dog\". 3. There is no way to know if the person has autism or not. It is up to the individual to decide. We can all agree that the most important thing to do is to take care of our blind friends. You can read more about this here .4. All these things can be measured. If we can understand how blind we are, then we will be able be more rational in our decisions. This is where the \"blindness paradox\" comes in.

That is a lot of money for the company. If someone were to sell that play to someone else, they would have to pay for it. Also, i believe they are constantly on the lookout for leaks of plays. They may also be looking for any leaks that might be on their computers or on other media they have access to. I know some companies have a leak protection policy which is really good for their employees but i don't know for sure why they do it or not. It would be very difficult to get an employee to sign off on this. There are also a few reasons why it's a bad idea for them to release a play and not for someone to watch. The biggest one is that you can't see it live in public. You have an enclosed space, so when someone looks at the screen you don’t have time to see the whole thing.

Since you're reading about 1500s European timeframe, the Pope still had considerable social power over the Catholic majority of Europe ( Protetsantism really didn't become numerically strong until the 1600s in northern europe). The Popes power was not curtailed significantly until the Enlightenment era..He could convince the Spanish Hapsburg Empire ( Catholic) to send his armies anywhere on the continent, and he could be an important asset in the Italian city-states rivalries because the Vatican had considerable economic clout.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A good question. I'm not sure if the answer is a good one, but i think i can get a sense of the historical context. Let's take the same question and say that the most important thing about the time is the general attitude of many people in the 16th century. What is it that makes this attitude so important? It's because of a lot of things. The most obvious is that there were a few monarchs, and the monarchies were more or less independent, independent from each other and from the rest of society. But there was a certain amount of money in circulation, there wasn't a much more powerful king or emperor. And it was very much a way of life for the people. So it's quite obvious that, because the king and emperor were the only ones that were allowed to control the economy. That's why there are so many monarchical monarchists. They're the ones who have the greatest influence on the entire country. This is why the state has a monarchy, which is very important for everybody. You could have a king who is responsible for a whole lot. It's important to remember that this is not just about money. There are other important things that are important, too. For instance, the monarchy was important because it kept the country in peace, it protected the national interest, not only for its own sake, you could say. So, what did you find out about that time?in the beginning, i don't know if you know what a monarch is, if it has to be, or if he has the power to do so. I didn't find it important at all. We have to have an understanding of what the term is. At the end of this period, a couple of people started to say, 'okay, this monarch's name is king david, right? So, we have this king of david.' they were very angry and said, \"well, he's a very powerful man, so what do we do about it?\" i thought, well, maybe we should give him the title of king of israel, instead of having to go through the process of making a new name. Because he was the first to become king, rather than the second one. He didnwhat did he do? He said to the king, with the help of his father, that he wanted to rule all the land, to reign over it, even though he had no right to that. Well, king benjamin, who was also the leader of all these kingdoms, was not going to take any part in this new king's rule. On the contrary, benjamin told him that all of these kings had to make a name for themselves, for their country, their people, all their possessions, as well as their religious beliefs. Then, at that moment, they had this idea, then, of how to deal with this problem. The king said that it would be better if benjamin became the new king. As i recall, in fact, when he heard that idea from benjamin's father in jerusalem, his mind immediately went to israel. When he saw that benjamin was going around the world, from jerusalem to paris, bringing in all sorts of ideas, people were talking about this. In fact he became so very enthusiastic about these ideas. During this time, everything began to change. First, during the period of peace in 1585 and 1586, israel began giving away a large portion of its land to them. Now, before that period in israel's history, jerusalem had become the capital of jerusalem. Before that point, these people had been very well off. Today, however, no one has any land left in their hands. Therefore, on that day, after the war, some people came to jerusalem and asked, how did we get to this point? That was one of those things where they asked the questions, without even knowing it. \"what is this land?\" \"this land of canaan, where we are, is where you are.\" and they started asking these questions. However, once they knew the truth, most of them were convinced that we were really going out of our way to get this to what we needed to. Since then we've been talking to a great deal of other people about how we can do this, about what to give up in order to establish this state, like the kingdom of god, palestine, egypt, etc. These people have not been able to understand the way that these things work. One of their ideas was that if we give them this kind of land and give it to us, let us give this country back to it and let them live in it in a free way, thus, since we had given them the right, give us the freedom to live under the law. (and then) they were going crazy. To them, now we're like, okay, can we put it back? Well they said no\n",

The *popes* were the elite of the nobility and kings of europa. They were a part of a ruling elite that was the main driver of society. It is possible that they had a strong alliance with other elites, but the only one i know of that i could think about is that of henry viii, who was a popid and had long been the leader of england's elite. I'm not sure if you're aware of this connection, and it's possible it was not directly related to the relationship between the english and the anglo-saxons. Edit: i accidentally left out the title of king of france. There are other sources, such as charles vii's *the empire of charlemagne* or the work of john s. Clark's \"the rise and fall of christianity\" which are worth reading. As for the other two, it would be an interesting read.

            "[Answer] There was a Soviet era movie adaptation of the novel, but perhaps you are familiar with this. The movie itself took five years to film and has a supporting cast of thousands in the battle scenes. Many sets, extraordinary period dresses - it might be hard to measure the overall cost of the film, but it's clear it must have had the extraordinary support of the government. Religion does play a role in the film; I was expecting some kitch Soviet propaganda, but I did not pick up on it (I only understand a little Russian, so am dependent on the subtitles). I'm not sure if the project would have been supported by earlier Soviet governments. Thanks for the recommendation on Briggs, I have yet to start the novel; looking forward to more authoritative answers to this question.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] During the Soviet era, \"War and Peace\" (also translated as \"War and Peace: A Novel in Five Parts\") was a highly acclaimed and influential work. The novel was written by Leo Tolstoy in the 1860s and 1870s, but it wasn't published until 1904. It was initially banned by the Russian government due to its perceived critique of the Russian imperial system and the nobility.\n",

            "However, after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the book became a national treasure and a cornerstone of Soviet literature. The Soviet Union officially recognized \"War and Peace\" as a literary masterpiece and a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Soviet government and the literary establishment viewed Tolstoy's work as a way to promote socialist values and ideals. The novel was seen as a critique of the excesses of the Russian aristocracy and the corruption of the imperial system. Tolstoy's portrayal of the Russian nobility and their involvement in the Napoleonic Wars was particularly seen as a way to highlight the social and economic injustices of the time.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] __________________on 1st may 1914 the german government issued a \"plan for the defence of the reich\", a document which laid the basis for an armistice with germany. The plan was to force germany to surrender on the part of russia, and to accept the terms of surrender.: the plan for a armistile treaty was a very effective way of getting the soviets to agree to the plan, as it would have given them a better understanding of how to deal with the situation, especially with regard to russia. It was an important part in establishing the peace treaty with russia that ended the war, so that the russians would not have to wait for their next war with them. It was also a great help to establish the agreement with france. : the 'plan of a defence agreement' was quite a good deal for russia and for germany, because it gave them some clarity about the nature of their role in the conflict, but also gave the germans a bit more understanding about how they would deal in a conflict between germany and russia in general. The 'plan' for war was probably the best way to get the ussr to allow the soviet union to take over the east, since it could not be put into practice if the west refused to give up its position. A few weeks later the us sent a message to germany that they were ready to make peace. A few days later, on 1 may, a letter from the president of germany read, in part, \"the following: 'we have been told that this is not a plan for peace, that it is only a form of blackmail, of war and war-mongering, for which the people of that country are responsible, if they will not accept it, then that is all. That is why we are prepared to send our troops to support the struggle, to secure the victory of our cause, which is our war'. This letter was sent on 21 may by us secretary of state john kerry to secretary john negroponte. He read the letter as follows:. . . On 27 may the united states sent its first message of its own to our allies, stating that we will do everything possible to provide for your peace in case of any attack on our territory. We have a lot of people in this country, many of them who have suffered under the occupation, who are fighting in front of you, they are not afraid to be heard and they have no fear of being attacked, we have all been assured that by our military strength, the russian army is capable of taking over your territory and that you are ready for that. As you know, our main objective is to protect the country and its people, not to kill or be killed. This is what our army and navy have always been for, this was our aim. I am certain that our people are able to cope with this and we do not want to do it again. But it must be remembered that in 1914, it took about ten days for us to prepare this document. On 14 may it had been sent to a number of important european countries, including belgium, france, germany; and it went to austria, poland, slovakia, czech republic, greece, russia; the uk, belgium and the netherlands, where it contained the main parts of this plan. In the meantime, there were some changes in our attitude, some of it less favorable, such as that of france in 1917, when we had to go to vienna, austria; but in 1920 we decided to put on hold the whole of 1918, even the first phase of 1919. And we did it at a time when the military situation was extremely difficult, with most of us being in advanced stages of struggle. Our plans were to bring about a war between us and germany on two fronts, one in europe, part and parcel of which was the balkans, i think, or the black sea, after which we would fight for them in all parts. If we could make it through the third phase, probably by 1917 and 1918 we might have won a decisive victory. So, at that time, you can say that there was no intention of giving up the fight, no idea of trying to achieve victory in 1918. What we were doing was, first of all, attacking the enemy, fighting the british and french, using the means of resistance, giving them the opportunity to develop their weapons, making them more effective. There was nothing that could have done this, only to prolong the fighting, shorten the duration of fighting and make us more able in future to defeat the enemies. Then, finally, by 1914 we reached a stage when, contrary to what we wanted, german forces could use the weapons of an anti-aircraft gunship. Therefore, everything was done in such a way as to ensure that, according to this theory, all the efforts of german troops were\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ian kershaw wrote a book called *the soviet revolution: the rise and fall of the western russian empire* in *soviet rome: a new history* (1956). It's a very interesting read. It doesn't take you to the core of what the russians were doing. The main thing i think is that the authors (i think kiersz) were looking for the most important aspects of rus' past. So, while i wouldn't say that their book is \"the most relevant\" in that it covers a large part of their history, it is an important read for those interested in the ussr's history.

            "[Answer] How do you sell perfume in a down-to-earth way? \"Buy our perfume! It's better than our competitor because....it smells good!\"  The sole purpose of perfume ad is to create brand awareness instead of being informative like drug ads (our allergy pills are more effective) or car ads (our cars are much safer than their car). Perfume formula don't change from year to year, so they can't say why it's better than the previous year's model. Perfume preference is extremely subjective, so it's hard to say your perfume smells better and explain why. We all know what perfumes do, you can't even do an ad base on that. Their ads are really just there to tell you they exist. You can't visually see the product being used, so they are usually trying to show either an idealized consumer of their product (use our perfume and you can be like her!) or the imaginary effect of their products (use our perfume and get laid!). When you try to convey an abstract idea, it's best to act it out rather than describe it with words.\n",

            "1. **Historical roots**: The perfume and cologne industries have a long history of using unconventional marketing techniques. In the past, perfume advertisements often featured elaborate sets, elaborate characters, and even puppeteers to convey the fragrance's personality.\n",
            "2. **Attention-grabbing**: Perfume and cologne advertisements are meant to grab the viewer's attention, which is why they often feature eye-catching imagery, such as colorful characters, elaborate sets, or even 3D models.\n",
            "3. **Emotional connection**: Perfume and cologne advertisements are designed to evoke emotions, such as romance, sophistication, or relaxation. By using unusual imagery, the ads create an emotional connection with the viewer.\n",
            "4. **High-end luxury**: Perfumes and colognes are often associated with high-end luxury and exclusivity. The use of unusual imagery may be intended to convey that the product is rare, exclusive, or of exceptional quality.\n",
            "5. **Marketing strategy**: Advertisements for perfumes and colognes often use a combination of psychological and behavioral techniques to influence the viewer's purchasing decisions. Unusual imagery may be used to create a sense of intrigue, curiosity, or even fear (e.g., the \"fear of not smelling your perfume\").\n",
            "6. **Brand identity**: Perfumes and colognes often have unique brand identities that are reflected in their advertising. Unusual imagery may be used to convey the brand's personality, values, or values.\n",

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] I have a theory. Perfumes are expensive, and you are going to want to buy a lot of them. So you want to buy the most expensive one. That's why you see them in a lot of ads. You want to buy a lot of them, so you want to show them off.  Also, perfumes are very strong, so you want to be able to smell them from a distance. So you want to show them off from a distance.  I think the other reason is that perfume ads are often very expensive to make. You want to show off how expensive they are, so you want to put them in an expensive setting.  I don't know the full story, but I think these are the main reasons.<|eot_id|>\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Baseline] The idea that the product will make you want to use it and not try it is a very common one. The same goes for the idea of the perfume. Why is this strange, and why is it so important to me?i don't know. I don, for example, have a fetish for perfume, or a taste for perfumed foods. But i do have some fond memories of these things. The first time i went to a perfume store, i was in the middle of my shift and my girlfriend asked me to order some perfume in advance of work. When i ordered the scent, she asked if i would like to buy it. \"if you like it, you can buy me some. You can also buy the fragrance yourself.\" i said, \"i'll buy a lot of perfume for you.\" so she gave me the order, got me a little bit of a bottle of it when i came home, gave it to her, then she brought it home and gave the bottle to the manager, who then took it back to my house. So i didn't have to take the smell of perfumery and perfume to work, which is why i am not a regular perfume buyer. This is what i like about the brand. The smell is very fresh and it's very natural. It's like a really, really good perfume (i'm talking about \"cigarot\"). Is it a big perfume company? __________in a sense it isn't. They are not big, they are a small company. And so they have been doing it for a long time. Like most perfume companies, there are two main brands. One is cologna (the brand name for it), and one is naturals. Numerals are the same as perfums, but they offer a different kind of fragrance. You can see that n&o is the one that is going to sell the most fragrances. If they sell a few more, n and o will be the next big ones. At least, that's what the c&n brand says. A few years ago, the company announced that it would be making a new fragrance called cascadian. Now, it has announced an update to its brand names. Coconut is called nautilus, cacao is named m&m, violets is renamed sperms, s&w is name of its own. There are other names, like giorgio armani. In my opinion, this is one of those things that i really like. To me, these are just some of their products. As far as i know, all of them have one thing in common.\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~there are a couple of reasons. 1) the cologne industry has a lot of money, so the ads are more like the kind you see on the cover of a magazine. 2) there are regulations on how you can advertise in the usa, and some countries have laws against selling alcohol in public. 3) some of the commercials are aimed at teenagers, which is a huge demographic. The whole point of cokes is that they're a product that's been around for a long time and has been pretty popular in europe. If you're trying to sell an ad on a tv show, you have to pay a very specific amount to make sure it's not being used for commercial purposes. This is not unheard of. There's even a law that forbids advertising on tv shows that are set in places that you don't want children to be exposed to. But that isn't all. And it isn’t limited to america. Other countries are doing the same thing. Edit: added some more info on alcohol. [here's](_url_0_) a few more sources. Tl;dr: the alcohol industry is huge and big. Many americans are really into it, because of their love of it. So many companies make it popular. Most american teens are into cuddly cudgels. Cuz they also like cuds. It and have it because it is popular and because they have a big market. For their parents. They like it so much they sell it very often. In americas are big, but also have huge.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] !!!you may also like:. This is what you'll find in the following:... And you may not even know it: this is the place to find your best friend. When i was a kid, i went to the local grocery store. They were all \"free-for-all\" and there was no problem, no one was asking for a discount. I knew i would get a free cart for $2.50. In fact, they had the best prices. My parents were so happy to see me get free. So i asked my mom if i could buy a cart, and she said, \"yes, we can!\" and i've never seen anyone buy an extra cart without asking. It was so nice to know they were looking for something that was free, something to be used, for free and then they said \"we'll give you a coupon.\" it wasn't too hard. This was the first time i'd ever been to a store that had free deals. There was an older woman there who was my best friends. She had a little kid who didn't even have a car. And she was in an expensive car and my friend was just looking at a picture of her car on the internet. But then she asked if we could give her a gift. \"sure, what's that?\" she told me. Then she looked at me and said she wanted a second car, so i had to take her and her friend to this place. The price was $5.00, which is just over $200. At first i thought it was cheap, but then i realized that i didn, in fact had some other car to give to my friends, because they wanted to get some for me to use. Not that they gave me anything. We were both really happy with the car we got. Later, my parents asked me if it would be a good idea to drive the kid to school, to buy groceries, etc. And i said yes. That's what i did. After the whole experience, it's easy to understand why i chose this store because it has so many great deals, some of which are free for you to purchase. Some of the deals are a bit of a hassle to navigate, like the price of \"jumbo basket\" which i purchased for about $1.99. For free shipping, you will have to pay the shipping and handling fees. If you don't have one, please take a look at my shop at the top of this page. Also, here is a great deal on \"rabbit\" so you can get one for the same price as your first order. You may find that it is very expensive, especially if you buy the \"bowl\" at your local store, not the other way around. A good way to think about it, is that if a person buys a package of $10 or less, then it will cost them $25. However, if they buy it for less than $20, or if the package is for more than that, that's a $50 discount, right? If they bought it at $30, plus shipping or handling, the cost will be $0.30. Therefore, when i buy something, usually the cheaper it gets, this will always be the one to choose. Remember, though, there are many free products out there.

I know you say that there are two ways to answer a \"problem\". The first is to simply tell your answer, and then the second is either to say you were lying or to make a joke about it. The answer to the last question has to be the same as the one to which you responded. It is always better to tell the answer if you have not been lying, than if the other way is true. You can also tell by telling your reply that it is correct. (i would suggest that the latter is your best bet, but i do not recommend it.) you should be careful to not say something that may be taken out of context. When you tell a story about a person's past, or about their future, it may not be true, because it would mean that their present is different. That is, if your story is about someone's family, their friends, etc., you may well be lying to them.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The reason i'm using this term is that it's more accurate than the term \"light pollution\". I will explain below why. I am not the first person to find this to be true. I think it is a useful comparison of the two. For example, i found the following graph, which shows that the sun is constantly in the upper right hand corner of this graph. This is because the average of temperature is equal to the solar radiation. (this graph shows the same thing as the graph above, with the sun's temperature in a lower right corner, but with a higher solar irradiance.)in the case of solar power, the higher the temperature, more co2 is released from the atmosphere, and the more energy is being released into the environment. In the situation of light pollution, this is an important distinction. On average, about half the co 2 from sunlight is emitted into our atmosphere each year. So, it can be seen that, on average in an atmosphere that is not too warm, co can reach about 100 times the amount of co dioxide in our climate. That is, if the intensity of sunlight in your atmosphere is more than 1,000 times that of that in sunlight, you can see that a 1-m2-th of a degree of climate change would result in more greenhouse gases being emitted. When this occurs, that 1/2 degree would mean that you could see 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide being burned every year, or about one million tons each of plants and animals being killed each day. If you are an urban dweller, for example. You would see more of these 1 million-ton tons. It is true that this 1 billion-tens of tons would cause the oceans to become more acidic, thus producing more carbon. But this would not be the whole story. The ocean is also more sensitive to temperature changes. As the ocean becomes warmer, so does the planet's surface. And as you move up the heat, as it cools, your water vapor is able to evaporate. These changes in water temperature can make the surface of your planet more vulnerable to heat and more susceptible to cooling. However, since the earth is surrounded by water, some of it will get colder as well. Since the water is so dense, its molecules can't absorb the extra heat. Therefore, even though the climate of an earth-like planet is warmer than that on the moon, most of our planet would be colder than this. We are also at the extreme end of some extreme temperatures. At the high end, there is much less co₂ that can get through the air. To put this in perspective, imagine a world where the world is on a flat surface, not covered by the sea. You would have a very small amount that could get out of there. Of course, a small part of you gets into that. Now imagine that there are a million people living on this flat planet. They are all in different stages of their lives. Your life span would get shorter if you were to live on one flat world. After all, what is the point of life if people lived on two flat worlds? Why are you living in two worlds if it would take a billion years to die on that flat earth? So you don't get the benefit of all of those benefits, in fact, at all. Instead, life on flat planets is just a tiny fraction of what you get when you live in one. Just the opposite. Life on earth was very different from living under the moon. Even though we live under a moon, we are living at a different time in space. There is no moon in orbit around the earth, although there were moons in mars. Also, mars is very cold and rocky. People from mars are more likely to develop cancers. Furthermore, scientists say that mars will have more volcanoes. One of them is called mount sharp. Some people believe that mount fuji is volcanic. No, mount mount shasta is actually a volcano. Because mount shimasta has a high elevation, volcanic activity can cause more lava to erupt on mount shu. What does this all mean? Well, according to some, mt. Fuji was the site of one of earth's most famous volcanos, named mount pinatubo. Well known for its volcanic eruptions, pinata is one such volcano on mt fuji. Pinati is located in central chile, along the border between the u. S. And chile. Mount panay is close to mount paolo. According to a recent study, \"in 2009, two volcanism experts from chile and argentina published a paper about the volcano and how it could be connected with mt pinato.\" the same paper is available here . Pina is named after a local mountain in pinay, called pinara. Apparently, during the 1950s and 1960s in chile many people from pinaya were living there, living with their families and working in mining, agriculture and other industries\n",

I think your question is more about how chivalry was perceived by the elites than how it was viewed in modern chu dynasty chiang kai-shek.

            "[Answer] They're disintegrating. It's kinda unusual for old, heavily washed fabrics to build up a ton of lint though. Usually you get major lint shedding the first few washes and then increasingly less as the fabric ages. You may notice that your towels are getting increasingly coarse as they age.

            "\n",
            "1. **Lint is not actually lint**: While it's true that the lint is a byproduct of the drying process, it's not actually lint. In fact, lint is the soft, fluffy fibers that are shed from clothing, towels, and other fabrics. These fibers can be quite fine and can easily become airborne.\n",
            "2. **Drying cycle**: The dryer's drying cycle can sometimes cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly cleaned or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.\n",
            "3. **Lint trap design**: The design of the lint trap can also contribute to lint accumulation. If the trap is not designed to catch lint, it can accumulate in the dryer and cause problems.\n",
            "4. **Drying cycle duration**: If the dryer is running for too long, it can cause the lint to become airborne and accumulate in the dryer trap. This is more likely to happen if the dryer is not properly loaded or if the lint trap is not functioning correctly.\n",
            "5. **Lint trap maintenance**: Regular maintenance of the lint trap is essential to prevent lint accumulation. This includes cleaning the lint trap regularly and replacing it if necessary.\n",

            "To minimize lint accumulation, you can try the following:\n",

            "* Regularly clean the lint trap and dryer vent.\n",
            "* Load the dryer correctly, with clothes and towels evenly distributed.\n",
            "* Run the dryer for a shorter duration than usual.\n",
            "* Use a lint trap with a built-in lint trap or a lint trap with a longer lint trap to catch more lint.\n",

In this case, the laundry detergent will keep the soap from dripping in all the way down. My answer to this question is to say that, if the detergents are not working, there's no way to make them work. You can simply make a small amount and run it through a clean dryant. How to make a clean dryant1. Clean the detergentas mentioned, you will need to clean the dryer.2. In a large pot, add the laundry detergent. This is very important. 3. Once the liquid is dissolved, mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Mix the wet and dry ingredients in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the top of the washcloth and rinse the cloth. The dry cleaner will start to smell like a detergie. When the water is done, rinse with cold water and let sit for 5-10 minutes. If the washed clothes are still wet, then rinse them with a little cold wash. You can use a cloth towel to wipe off the stains. I use the old towel that i bought for my washing machine, i don. The one that is still clean. Also, use some paper towels to pat the bottom of your towel. They will stick to the towel and not on the fabric. 3. Place the towel back into the washing pot. 4. Remove the washcloth. 5. Apply a heavy, wet cloth over it. 6. Put the cloth towels back in and lay them out on a towel rack. 7. Leave the clearant to dry. 8. Use a wet towel or a damp cloth to rinse. 9. To make the clean drying towell, place a dry cloth on top and place the wipe toward tow. 10. Let it dry in about 5 minutes, and then wash the wettest clothes. 11. Set the cleanser on. 12. After 5 mins, wash again and put the towels back on and wait for the cleaning to finish. 13. Now, try to get rid of all of these clothes and the stain. 14. Turn off all lights, turn off any lights that you dont like, remove the light fixture that your laundry is using, clean and wipe the clean cloth off. 15. Finish with the clearant and wash your clothes, just like before. 16. Keep in mind that this is not the same as washing a wash cloth, this can be done with any detergenic soap. 17. Do not use any soap with soap residue. 18. Just wipe away all residue and try again. 19. As you go into washing, do not let the residue on your washcloths, they are the ones that have to stay clean, don't do that. 20. Using a different detergen will make your detergs even more toxic, so be sure to use an alcohol-based detergelator. 21. It is best to wash clothes using the bleach, since it can get the mess from the cleaners. 22. For more information about how to do this, check out the information i provided on this blog. 23. Remember, once the clothing has been thoroughly cleaned, it will smell much better and be easier to remove. 24. Take a look at the pictures below. 25. Here is the original picture, that we used for this post, in its original state. 26. Notice the difference in color between the white and black clothes? 27. What does that mean? 28. And how does this affect the color of my laundry? 29. How does it affect my cleaning? 30. Can you tell me about the odor? 31. Okay, now i know what the smell is like. 32. So, how is it different from what i have seen before? 33. Is it the scent or the temperature? 34. Why is that? 35. Where are my clothes stored? 36.

It may sound like that language to the uneducated because it uses known sounds and verbages but is in reality nothing but gibberish. I apologize for possibly sounding racist here but it's like saying \"Ching chong chang\" and claiming you speak Chinese. More commonly it also refers to a technique used by religious preachers to babble language that is said to be divine language or God speaking through them. Using the technique to claim that it is part of the religious experience. Research into the phenomenon however has shown that it in fact has hypnotic properties and is basically used to brainwash people.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think the first thing i did was to ask the question. I had been studying english in college for a while and i started learning the language in english class. The first question i got was, \"how do you pronounce a word?\" and it was a good question, because i knew what i was talking about. But i didn't know how to pronounce it. So i wrote down what was called a pronunciative word, and then i looked at my dictionary and found a list of pronouncing words, which was the best i could find. So i decided to do a little research, but i wasn't sure what to expect. In fact, i thought i'd be surprised if i ever did. I actually was expecting to see some of the pronunciation sounds that people had to give me. Well, they were quite different. Some of them were more verbose, some more masculine, or some were just a bit more formal. It was very easy to read. And i found that there were some very good pronailing sounds, like \"he,\" \"she,\" and \"it.\"but in fact i only had one word that was pronounced correctly: \"it.\" and when i asked, it just said \"he.\" it wasnwell, that's pretty impressive. Now i'm just going to tell you something, though. When i first started studying the pronunciation of words and the sounds of different pronutations, there was an awful lot of confusion, especially in my class, where i would have to use both \"you\" and other pronutation words. That's a real problem. You get confused when you don't get what you want. Like i said, you just have a few things to say that you can't say. For example, in french, the word \"le mouvre\" means \"that's not what it is.\" in english, when \"let it go\" is pronounced, this is a \"i\" or \"y\" sound. There was one instance where we had a lot more confusion when we said that \"if you do that, then it's fine.\" so you have something to add to that. Of course, we're in a situation where it would be more accurate to make a sentence like,if you are going out, get out. If you're going in, let it come. \"if it comes, please come.\" that was sort of a classic french thing. Because i remember that i used to have one sentence that said something like that and another one that just kept saying that until it came. We were like the second generation. One day, a girl came up to me and said to my mother, hey, come, are you ok? And she said she was okay, she had just been walking around the house. She said it had something in it for her. What's the problem?there were many examples of that sort, of people saying things like this, saying it doesn't have anything to it, to them, people like to be in the middle of things and not know what's going on. To me, my language teacher, as you know, is the one person who can really help me get to the point where if someone is in that situation, who is going into it without knowing what the situation is, what they're doing and what their intentions are, if you understand the thing, how they feel, just knowing that that person's doing it and that it has something or what needs to happen and when that happens, can you help them understand that? So that kind of person is really a really good person. Just like i am. Maybe my teachers can help you out there.\n",

For example, when you're in a room with a bunch of people talking, it would be nice if everyone was quiet, but they could talk and the kids wouldn't have to be that way. I think it might also be a learned behavior. If you talk to someone who knows you can't speak, they might be able to tell you how to speak better because it makes you feel more comfortable. It may also have something to do with our language. So we can teach ourselves to use words that we know we'll be using to convey our feelings. And when we do it, we are teaching ourselves how words are used, so that the person who learned it will be comfortable with it and can use it to communicate with us.

            "\n",
            "[Answer] Because those are the character's most recognizable, most easily created and most evil enemies. Sure, you can have Batman go against Mr Freeze, but you have to explain who he is. Instead you have a man dedicating his life to order go against the human embodiment of chaos. You can have Spiderman need to fight off the Rhino or Scorpion, but then you have to explain to people that these guys are villains and not furries. Instead you have relatively average human Peter Parker go up against a giant corporation and an alien parasite (venom). Superman has some cool villains, but all are too expensive to make or have too large of a backstory to show in a single movie. Hence why you do see things like Doomsday, Apocalypse and Brainiac, but usually just in the TV series or in an animated movie. Instead it's easier to have everyman Clark Kent go against billionaire Luthor.\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Baseline] The repetition of the same villains in superhero movies can be attributed to several reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Established lore**: Many superhero franchises have a rich history of characters, villains, and storylines. By reusing familiar villains, filmmakers can maintain continuity and avoid contradicting previous films.\n",
            "2. **Character consistency**: Reusing villains allows filmmakers to maintain character consistency, ensuring that the same characters behave in the same way. This consistency helps to build a cohesive and engaging story.\n",
            "3. **Pacing and plot**: Reusing villains can also help with pacing and plot. By not introducing new villains, filmmakers can avoid disrupting the narrative flow and maintain a consistent pace.\n",
            "4. **Franchise branding**: Reusing villains can also be a way to reinforce franchise branding. By using familiar villains, filmmakers can create a sense of continuity and familiarity among fans, which can be beneficial for the franchise's overall appeal.\n",
            "5. **Budget and logistics**: Reusing villains can also be more budget-friendly and logistically easier. Using familiar villains means less need for elaborate set designs, costumes, and stunts, which can save money and reduce production time.\n",
            "\n",
            "That being said, some critics argue that reusing villains can be a missed opportunity for innovation and creativity. By not introducing new villains, filmmakers may miss the chance to explore fresh ideas and themes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of the Batman franchise, the reuse of villains like the Joker and the Riddler can be seen as a missed opportunity for innovation. The Joker, in particular, has been portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in \"Joker\" and Joaquin's portrayal of the character has been widely praised. While it's understandable that the filmmakers may have wanted to explore other interpretations of the character, the fact remains that the Joker is a iconic and complex villain who deserves more attention.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of Spider-Man, the reuse of villains like the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus can be seen as a missed opportunity for innovation. The Green Goblin, in particular, has been portrayed by Willem Dafoe in multiple Spider-Man films, and while Dafoe's portrayal of the character has been widely praised, it's also been argued that the character could have been explored in greater depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the reuse of villains in superhero movies can be seen as a creative choice that prioritizes franchise branding, character consistency, and pacing over innovation and originality.<|eot_id|>\n",

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] The most common reason is that there's a certain kind of audience that really enjoys the same villains. Batman, Spiderman, and Superman are all very popular, so it's not uncommon to see them in a movie. This is why you'll often see them in the same movie, or in the same movie with other characters that are also popular.  The other reason is that these movies are all really good, and you want to see them again. You're a fan, so you want to see them again. If you don't like the movie, you might not go see it again, but if you like it, you'll go see it again.  This is why you'll often see the same movies, and why they're all so popular.<|eot_id|>\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Baseline] There's a good reason for this. Batman (2005) and spiderman (2007) both use the name of a super villain. However, the origin of this trope is a mystery. It's usually referred to as \"supervillain\" because of their strong, super-powered personalities, and their ability to change their reality to fit their needs. This is why the supervillains are often portrayed as a way to break free of all of that. This trope has been a staple of comic books since the 1960s, with the first of these being \"the man who killed the joker\". It also seems to be a big part of some marvel movies, as it was one of my favorite superhero films of all-star weekend. I'm not sure why there's no other superhero movie that does this, but i can't help but wonder if it's because the heroes are so different.\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Irl, it's the \"hero\" thing that makes it so that it doesn't seem like it has to be the exact same character. A good example is the avengers, which was set in the 90s and was never released in theaters. They have changed a lot since then. The reason it continues to exist is because of that. There are lots of different versions of avenger and avenged movies, and the fact that they're all the heroes makes them look like the one that got the most attention. It just seems to happen more and more often, because people are more likely to watch them, even if they don't know how the story is going. That's why it keeps happening, to an extent. I'm sure there's a few other reasons, but the big one is that people aren't used to the current superhero genre, so it feels like a better time to have a new one. So the best thing to do is get new versions, like when the old ones are released, or if the new ones aren’t popular. Then people just like new stories. This.

            "\n",
            "[Answer] Short answer, yes. The stuff in the food that we can smell enters the air more easily when warm.  The real answer is that aromatic compounds are more volatile at higher temperatures.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] When food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds into the air. These compounds are the molecules that give us the smell of food. Here's why we can smell food more easily when it's hot:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs):** When food is hot, the Maillard reaction occurs, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is cooked. This reaction produces more VOCs, which are the molecules responsible for our sense of smell.\n",
            "2. **Enhanced volatile emissions:** Hot food releases more VOCs into the air, making the scent of the food more intense and pronounced.\n",
            "3. **Increased aldehyde release:** Aldehydes are a type of VOC that is released when food is heated. They are responsible for the characteristic \"aromatic\" or \"fatty\" smell of cooked foods.\n",
            "4. **Smell of the cooking process:** When food is hot, it can also release the smell of the cooking process, such as the aroma of butter or oil. These smells can be more intense when food is hot, making the food more appetizing.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, when food is hot, it releases more volatile compounds, which are responsible for our sense of smell. This is why we can smell food more easily when it's hot, and why cooking food can be such a sensory experience.<|eot_id|>\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Finetuned] Smelling food is more of a sensation than a smell, it's just your nose detecting molecules. When you smell something, it's because you have receptors in your nose that can detect the molecules. When the molecules are hot, they are moving around more quickly, so your nose can detect them more easily.  The hot food is also more volatile, so it's more likely that it will be able to escape your nose and into your lungs. This is why you can smell food even if it's cold, but you can't smell it if it's frozen.<|eot_id|>\n",

Well, i use a pair of thermaltake i2c thermic lamps. Therms are very light, so i will have to give them a shot. I also like to have a small set of small leds on the end of the lamp. There are a few that are smaller and more light-efficient, and some that have even more power. The therma is also light enough to be used with a lamp, though i do think that the thermos should have more leds. So, a thermo is just a good choice if you are looking for a simple light source. You can also use it as a heating pad or as an extra warm lamp that you can use in your bathroom or on your counter. A therme is much more expensive and has to work harder.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the heat is heating up the molecules of the substance you're smelling.~~ this is what makes it taste better. It also means that when you smell something, you are actually tasting a chemical that your brain interprets as smell. So when something is very hot, your taste buds are primed to detect the chemical, and so your body will smell the smell of that food. This also explains why you can smell things much hotter than you normally would, which is why it's usually a good idea to use an oven to cook food before cooking it, as the heat will be transferred through the meat to the air and into the stomach. Edit: spelling. I'm not a scientist, but i do know that the difference in temperature between the hot and the cold air is due to a combination of air pressure and temperature differences. The colder air has more air to carry heat away, so it will burn more quickly. When there is more food to eat, the temperature will change, thus allowing the same amount of heat to be released.

            "[Answer] There's a famous unidentified body from 19th century Paris--a beautiful young woman known only as \"L'inconnue de la Seine\" (the unknown of the Seine River). Her body was recovered and the mortician made a face mask of her so that she could be identified more easily--looking at a mask is a lot more appealing than looking at a rotting dead body. Because of her beauty, she drew a lot of attention, but in some other cases, they also did molds of the face. Once photography was available, photos might be taken of the unidentified after they were buried. In this case, though, she was never identified, but her face became a popular work of art, and the Resuscitation doll used in Red Cross classes on CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, now has her face.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] In olden times, handling unidentified dead bodies was often a challenging and often traumatic process. Before the development of refrigerated morgues, here are some of the ways they were handled:\n",

            "1. **Burying in mass graves**: In many ancient cultures, dead bodies were often buried in mass graves or trenches, which were then covered with soil and covered with the dead bodies of other individuals. This practice was common in ancient Rome, China, and other cultures.\n",
            "2. **Disposal in rivers or oceans**: In some cases, dead bodies were thrown into rivers or oceans, where they would eventually be consumed by aquatic life or washed into the sea.\n",
            "3. **Burial in the countryside**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in the countryside, away from cities and towns. This was often the case in medieval Europe, where the countryside was often used as a burial ground.\n",
            "4. **Morgues in churches and monasteries**: In some cases, dead bodies were taken to churches and monasteries, where they were buried in the churchyard or on the monastery grounds. This practice was common in medieval Europe.\n",
            "5. **Burying in a family plot**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in a family plot, where they were interred with the deceased family members.\n",
            "6. **Burial in a common grave**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in a common grave, which was often located in a churchyard or other public area.\n",
            "7. **Use of 'body pits'**: In some cases, dead bodies were buried in 'body pits', which were shallow pits dug in a field or other open area. These pits were often used as burial grounds for multiple individuals.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A very long time ago. One of the most famous cases of morgue work, in new york city, was the \"alfred\" g. Bales, aposter boy for the national society of forensic medicine who had died in the united states in 1942. The body ofalden g., a young man who was in his 20s, had been found in a morgie at a new jersey gas station in 1940. The gas company had discovered the body in november of 1942 and had to take the man to a mortuary to remove the corpse. He died on december 19, 1942, and the morgeys continued to find him. There was no record of his death. Why would a man so young die in this way? The answer is simple. It was because of an accident. According to the coroner's report, the death was caused by a blow to one of her ear. She called for medical attention and a \"medical examination\" was done. This is what was found on the scene of aldene's death:alderne g's head and neck were found near her bed, with a broken bone in her head. Her body was discovered a few days later at her home in long island city. Alderna's body had also been discovered in that state. In an autopsy report dated june 5, 1943, auldene stated that she had suffered a head injury during a fall at the age of 15. On june 20, she was pronounced dead. It would seem that anderne's family was not happy with the way things were going in their home. After her death, her son, robert, took the family to an old cemetery. Robert a. G was buried in april of 1945, at long beach cemetery. His burial place was a large church in south beach. Many of those buried at this cemetery had a history of crime. One of them was frank a., whowas a member of a mob that murdered at least 50 people. Frank was shot by his own brother. At the end of that year, frank's brother died of natural causes. As a result, his brother frank g, who died at age 26, went to prison for four years. During the time of frank, many of these people were living in prison. But, that did not stop the authorities from investigating. They arrested frank and charged him with murder. If frank had ever been a criminal, he would have been charged with this crime, because he was so close to his father, which is why the prosecution had him locked up in state prison in 1947. While frank would not be a major criminal in most states, they did find evidence that he had committed some of their murders. For example, on september 14, 1949, two women were murdered in boca raton, florida. Police found a car with three men and one woman in it, as well as a gun and ammunition, along with drugs and money. That's how much they stole. So, why was they found with all of this evidence? The answer to that question is that they had some kind of \"dead man's note\" which they took to their local police station. These notes were made in order to track down the victims. However, these notes did have some significance. When police began to see the notes, some would say that the police were investigating the crime scene. Others would suggest that this is how they were able to locate the bodies. Although some police would go so far as to say \"the police are investigating it,\" others would question if this was how the police department was doing it. Because of how these police reports were kept, it is possible that some were not taken into consideration when they made their initial investigation. Sometimes the reports might have a specific purpose, such as identifying the victim and identifying a crime that had occurred. Also, when these reports came to light, there was some controversy as the details of what had happened could have caused the deaths. What happened to frank? The case of robert g is a mystery to many. Why did he die? Well, one thing is for sure, this would explain why he did this. We do know that a lot of people who were victims of murders in other parts of america were killed by the same type of killers. Therefore, we know this about robert. Let's take a look at what happened on november 15, 1948. Before the murders occurred, john h. Was living at his parents' house in brooklyn. H was working in an office building. John was just 22 when he died. I think it was around the beginning of january, 1950. My father and i were in our office in my office, sitting at our desk. About 10:00 a. M., john came home from work. . . He said, \"i have seen that dead body. You can see it.\"\n",

There are many. But for the most part, there was no way to get the corpses to be buried. You just needed to bury them. A large funeral was held, usually in the middle of a massive graveyard. That meant that the body was wrapped in linen, then put in coffins or a coffin, or put into a coffer, etc. The corpse would be put to sleep. Once it got there, it would lay there until it died. This is common to find dead people buried in wooden cofferdoes, in which the coffin would also be wrapped, often. Most of these coffinders were in very close to each other, as a sort of an easy way of drying them being sealed and thus keeping the bodies in place. When you find the remains in some kind of coffers. They would often have been sealed, they are usually sealed to keep them dry and then carried by water. [sources]( (_url^1). This was also a common place for burial vaults. So if it wasn't the place of death. If the coffders were dug up, you would have a lot of bodies were buried on the ground. Sometimes the grave would usually a burial ground or grave, buried under a grave. Also sometimes, graves were often made of dead. Then buried as well. And cremations were done. These were usually with a body of animals, either buried by burying them, a caskets, burned, sometimes with the bones of deceased. Some were made into coffings or burnt in ashes.

They have also been shown to be able, even if they can't break a passport, to steal a foreign person, such as an american. They can also make a duplicate of a citizen or a u. S. Citizen, which is pretty much the same thing. So, what do we know about the origin of passports? The only thing that's known is that a lot of them were made by a local bank. But the most interesting thing is the fact that this was done by the uavs of the time. The first time i heard about this, i was not so sure. I asked a friend of mine, who i knew as the manager of an airline, if he was aware of this and he said \"of course. This is how it works in real life.\" i thought, \"what if it's a cia agent or something?\" it was. I was amazed at how easily he could have learned from me that i had been doing this for a long time and i am very much grateful to him for his help. In fact, he is still the guy who did this to my passport and has been making it ever since. He also told me a story about how his wife was caught in the act of breaking into his passport in 1996 when he had a visa application for her. She was a canadian citizen and had to go to the united states to apply for an alien visa. So, when she came back home, she was just so shocked at the situation that she said, in english,\"i can get a job in a bank, so i can be on a plane and have a new passport.\"this is exactly what she did. It took her about a week and a half to do the whole thing, and she got a good job. Now she has a couple of other kids and some other friends. And they have been living in my house for about four years now. There is an apartment in her house. Her husband has lived there for over three years. All of us are in this state. We are all in our 20s. And she is living with a family. My wife is in college. One of her friends is a junior at a high school in canada. Two of our friends are here. Both of these people are living here for almost three months now and they all work hard. What i've learned is this: a large number of people have taken advantage of fake passports for their own personal gain, but the people who are making these passports are using them for the sole purpose of making money and the rest of it is just a matter of luck. People are doing it to pay their bills and to avoid having to live in fear of being stolen. That is why it has become so difficult for people to come forward. If they want to speak to us, they must first go through our online information center. Then they should go out and buy a copy of their passport for themselves. Once they get the passport they need to return it and pay back the money they made. You have to trust that if you are going to spend money on something like this you will pay for it. Just remember, this is your money. No one has to take it away from you. Everyone has the right to have it back. For example, my wife and my two kids are now living and working in new york city. Their mother is also living there now with her two children. These people don't need this money, because they will be in poverty. As for me, it will take a while for this one to happen.\n",

If you're going into a recession, you can't get the money back. You need to raise taxes on the rich, and you need the big banks to lend money to the banks.\"the stimulus is what happens when the fed runs a deficit, because the federal reserve runs an interest rate that is higher than the interest rates of the other banks and they want to get back their money, so they run up interest on their deposits and then they go back to paying interest, but they don't have to pay anything back in the form of interest. That is why the stimulus works. The government has to borrow money from banks, it doesn't need a bank loan. It just takes the bank out of business, puts it in a savings account, pays it back, gets back the next interest that you put in, the balance is taken out and that's the nature of a fiscal stimulus.\" ___________________________________________________________________________as discussed in this article, keynesian economics is based on a classical \"fiscal theory.\" however, some economists and economists are also concerned with how the fiscal policy of any government is used. In this post, i will discuss the classical keynesians and the current fiscal issues. ____________________________the following is an excerpt from an article i wrote for the new york times that i had written in february of 2010. (i am writing this because i have been working on this topic for quite some time. I am not sure how long it will take me to finish the article but i'll be back with a more recent summary soon.)in his essay, ludwig von mises, who had been a member of keynes's central bank, has argued that the present monetary policy has been \"very inefficient.\" he writes,it is true that in recent years, in order to make up for all the problems we have, a number of countries have begun to expand their monetary and fiscal policies. But the problem is that many of these countries are still very much in their infancy. Even with these changes, they still are using the same kind of monetary policies, or, as keynes put it, \"they are far from getting what they are supposed to.\" for instance, with respect to monetary expansion, no country has ever been able to increase the level of its budget deficit. Rather, this is because, although the country's gdp is growing, its spending is still growing. This means that, if it were to keep expanding, that country would be in trouble. A very similar problem could be faced if a country were not to cut spending in an attempt to avoid further economic problems. Such a situation would have a serious impact on economic growth. When we look at the real world, there is very little difference in economic activity between countries that are in recession and those that have seen a recovery. However much economic progress can be made, these two countries still have much to learn from each other. Therefore, when we talk about the 'economic recession,' we should also refer to those countries which are experiencing a similar economic crisis. And in that sense, what we are talking about is not the recession of 2008, nor the great recession, of which the united states is one of them. We are dealing with something that we do not know about, namely the effect of our own policy choices. Now, let me turn to another important issue. Since i want you to understand that this essay is about macroeconomics, rather than economics itself, here is another quote from misek that explains why keynes is wrong. He writes: \"the first thing we must do is to find the right balance between the two types of economic policy. What we can do, however, is get a balance. All economic decisions are based upon a combination of two or more factors. There is no doubt that these factors, like the financial crisis, have led to a huge increase in investment. Moreover, at some point, even before the crisis started, investment was extremely low. Today, on average, people have an average of $3,500 per year in assets. These are all assets that can go into retirement. As a result, our government, under the conditions of austerity, cannot pay its bills. On the contrary, all our people live on zero income. So, while the majority of us live in poverty, those who are living in debt have little or no hope of getting on with their lives. One of my favorite quotes from keynes was in his famous \"mises lecture.\" \"we must think of ourselves as\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ianas he explained that it was a tax on investment and consumption. I think this is what he meant. _url_0_ > as the tax code was enacted, the administration proposed a plan that would tax the rich at the top, and the poor at lower levels. > the plan would allow the wealthy to invest their wealth in companies that were more efficient. This would provide tax relief to those who had invested in the companies, while also allowing the lower-income individuals to use their own money to buy products and services. The government would also increase the amount of taxes that the individual could pay based on their income. It would be a very complicated and complex tax system. In fact, it is a terrible idea. One of the best examples of this was the iran hostage crisis. During the hostage situation, iranian forces were able to attack the us treasury. Many people thought that this kind of a deal was impossible, but in reality it just made it worse. When the hostages were released, many realized that they had already lost a lot of money. They were so distraught that their government was forced to end the debt, which was unsustainable. Basically, so they decided to try and create a new system that had no benefit for the people. By cutting taxes, they actually reduced the size of government, instead of giving everyone more money, rather than taking money out of people, or cutting jobs, people that could never make money as they could not do anything. So, those people were not make any more. Because of course, this created the economy was not sustainable. As far as i understand it went, most americans were the middle class people could no longer make more of middle classes, some people who couldn't make as much money from the taxes. And therefore, richer and they didn't have any money in a whole economy. Therefore the most of all the money made no more middle-class people lost money that was all of them, everyone. **the middle tax cuts.** in short, when they tried to get rid of everyone, wealth and wealth became less. Then the bottom class, as a result, a larger percentage of those that no wealth had to be taxed. People made less money was taxed, less, not everyone had more wealth. (and so the more people got taxed more, because they would have less of it. For a wider range of things. Just like a better economy and more jobs. Everyone lost wealth, more was lost. Edit: and also the way to explain it, there was no one thing. You can't just say that. Like any other time a government \"tax plan is bad. Or tax changes are bad, you have to have better outcomes. That are good, no other than the worst. A bad thing is the economic system is good. Its a problem. An economic model is better. Not just one. There is an idea that is not. But a good thing and people are still bad because it isn't. Some of that thing, that there are a few bad things too. If you are making a great thing a system too much. No it's bad if people get better things in government. Good things are the opposite. Better than a solution. *the system we have already done it too bad it! *some people have been bad and bad too big.* and some things that need to do better the thing too great. Is that bad is wrong. More than people can not have a worse things happen. Answer. [us the question is why people lose money and why the answer is. Yes, if the problem is \"the economy is too good\". The simple answer, is because the idea is it has a question. What you get. Think. Please, please. :) edit 2: sorry. Thanks for spelling. /u/uu/-my username. 2u/. U.

Because the antibiotics are interfering with your immune system. Your immune system is responsible for fighting off infections, and the antibiotics are interfering with it. If you take antibiotics for too long, your immune system will be weakened, making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may develop a condition called \"blood dyscrasia\". This is a condition where your blood is abnormal, and you will have difficulty producing enough red blood cells.  If you take antibiotics for too long, you may also develop a condition called \"blood clotting\". This is where your blood gets too thick, and it is harder for your blood to clot. If you take antibiotics for too long, you may develop a condition called \"blood clots\".

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the reason that you have to give blood is to save the life of a person who died from the disease.~~ this is why it's called a [pharmacy donation](_url_0_). The reason for this, i believe, is because the amount of blood you are giving is limited. If you only have 10-15ml of the blood, then you're taking out a lot of tissue. This means that the donated blood will be very large. As a result, it will not be able to be used for other medical purposes. And if it is, you can get a transfusion of that blood. That's why the first blood bank in the us requires you to have a blood donation. Once you've done that, the transfusions are free. The problem is that there's a large amount going to the liver, kidneys, and other tissues. There are also a number of other parts of your body that need blood (e. G. Heart, lungs, liver), so you might not get enough to do the job. I hope this helps.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] Yes, some planets orbit each other and some orbit their own. In fact, the orbits of many of these planets are very similar, but the orbit of most of them is so small that it is hard to tell whether they are orbiting the sun or not. The orbital distance of the earth from the planet is about 1.5 times the distance from it to the moon. This means that the average distance to a planet from earth is around 1/10th of a mile. If the diameter of this planet were 1,000 miles, then that would be the equivalent of 6.3 billion miles. For a star, this would mean that an average of 1 million miles per second. That's a lot of space for a single star to travel through. And for the planets, they orbit one another like an earth orbit. But, as we have seen, there are some very small planets orbiting all around the solar system. So, if the radius of each planet was 1 micron, it would have to be 2.4 microns. The sun and earth, right? Answer: yes, one planet orbits the other planet and that orbits earth. The earth orbits saturn and the moon, and even the stars. But earth and saturn orbit around eachother, so the orbital distances are not as large as the distances from one star and one moon to earth (and that's not an accurate representation of how much distance the star can travel, since it has no gravity at all, just the amount of material to hold it together). So, for example, in the picture above, earth's orbit is 1 (1.0) micrometers from saturn. Earth has a diameter about 4.7 micers, which is approximately the size of our planet. In the long term, a 1-micron planet could cover about a quarter of earth in space. A 1 kilometer planet would cover half the landmass of mars, giving earth about half of its surface area. An earth-sized planet of similar size would also be a very nice object. At the very least, we would need to find planets that orbit with the mass of one of those planets. As mentioned, all the light that comes out of their orbit (like the sunlight from a sun) travels through the atmosphere and into our own solar systems, like a jet engine. When a satellite's engine goes out, or a spacecraft's engines go out (or even into space), the fuel in that engine is used to make the spacecraft move. It is not a bad thing to have the engines of any spacecraft, even one that has been launched by a human, go to space in order to refuel. One wonders if it was ever possible to land a rocket on a surface that was not covered by any atmosphere. Why not just send an astronaut on an orbiting mission to orbit earth?for the sake of illustration, let's look at the second image, taken from nasa's goddard space flight center's (gfsc) earth satellite. Earth was the first satellite ever built to visit the red planet. All the satellites were designed to go in one direction, because the satellite was designed not to cross over. (the earth satellites did not go into orbit in any other direction.) the first one, called the \"earth-oriented\" mission, was launched in may 2001. Since then, nasa has built several more satellites to carry astronauts to and from mars. After that, their mission was called earth opportunity, launched on june 10, 2004. Nasa had its first launch on september 3, 2005. We have been following this mission ever since, with several missions to mars (including the mars odyssey mission in june 2004) and several trips to jupiter (mars odyssey was also launched as a mission on april 24, 2006). This is a big step forward in our understanding of what the early history of human history is like. Also, i am sure that many people will have a hard time believing that these missions were ever going to happen. There are many things that are impossible to believe. However, that is the main reason why they were not successful. Most of us were already familiar with how the universe works. Some people would think that we were going back in time and re-establishing the order of things in this universe. Others would say that there is no such thing as \"time\". It would appear that some of you are wrong. Our universe is an infinite universe, where time is finite, only an absolute number of particles and atoms are able to exist at once. I have learned this fact from my own experience and experience with other planets and stars, such as neptune and pluto. Many of my colleagues have also been wrong about the fact that our universe was created in such a way that time was never more than a few billion years old. These days, though, you can see that this is very difficult to explain. What we do know is that all\n",

I'm not sure if it is the case that you could go to the trouble of finding new bacteria or just going to your local microbiology lab. However, if you go in to an area that has a lot of bacterial colonies, like the great lakes, you might find some new strains of bacillus. These bacteria are also very common in other parts of the world. In fact, i know that the biggest concern about the big bang was the expansion of space.

            "5. **Philosophy is Not a Relevant Subject in the Public Sector**: Public schools often focus on preparing students for the workforce, rather than providing them with a philosophical education that can help them navigate complex social and cultural issues.\n",
            "6. **Cultural and Social Norms**: Philosophical discussions often require a level of cultural and social nuance that may not be expected in public schools.\n",
            "7. **No State Mandate**: Unlike mathematics, there is no state mandate to teach philosophy in public schools. This means that schools are not required to include philosophical discussions in their curriculum.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] It's not taught at all. It's taught as an afterthought in public school, where it's a matter of pride and pride of place. I want to make a distinction between the three main forms of philosophy: the philosophical, the intellectual, and the non-philosophical. The nonphilological form is one that is based on the idea that all things are self-evident. So, for instance, if i am a dog, i will not be able to see anything if it is a small dog. I don't want a large dog to be seen. But there are philosophers who have been taught that there is nothing to no such thing as a good dog because they believe that the human mind is always selflessly doing its best. This is not the way philosophy is taught. Philosophy is only taught when it has a certain degree of philosophical rigor and rigour and of conviction. And it also has to have some sort of respect for those who practice it, because that's what philosophy does. If you have a philosophical teacher who wants to teach you to follow philosophy, he will teach that to you. You will be taught to believe in philosophy. That's all right. There is no philosophical school in the world that teaches you that. Instead, you are taught the very same thing that you were taught before, that philosophy teaches. In fact, there's no one teaching you philosophy in school. Just as there isn'n't a philosopher in any of the major universities in this country, it isnt even a member of a major public university. What this means is that a philosophy teacher in a public institution is required to train you in what you can think. He or she is supposed to develop your own ideas, to discover new ideas. To be a part of that process is to become an expert in that field. These things donts take a lot of time. They take more time than you think, but they take you a long time to get to know. A philosopher is an experienced person who has been trained in many different fields. Some of them are very different from other philosophers. For example, aristotle, plato, aquinas, hegel, etc. All have very similar ideas about things. (p. 8)we are also taught, as we were, in some schools that they teach philosophy as the second form of education. We are told that this is because it teaches us that we are not alone in our mind, so that our actions are all the same. Here, they also teach us the opposite: that it doesnti teach we that things can be made to work, not because the action of doing so is selfless, which is what we think it does, we believe it to mean that everything can work. Now, some philosophers say that if we only believe what they say, then everything will work; that no actions can ever be created by an action. Or they go on to say there can never be an act that can create an effect. Is this true? I think that some of these things happen because we have beliefs. Then, this way of thinking about it seems to me to contradict what the philosophy teachers teach. First of all, philosophy has no idea of what it means to exist. Philosophers are always talking about what is real and what isn. Therefore, a person's true self is never a thing. An action is just a possibility, an experience. Not a fact. When you look at an object, whether it be the person or the thing, what happens to that object is the experience of its being. Everything that happens is possible. Something is true. Nothing is impossible. Because everything is so real, things that exist are possible and are real. Things that do not exist exist, only exist because of something that exists. Hence, anything that doesn't exist can exist at any given moment. People are talking all day long about the difference between a real world and an imaginary world, about how the things in question can behave. As i said before: there are no real things, no imaginary things; they are the laws of nature. Our consciousness is made up of some real thing called a reality. All that realness is created out of an actuality of reality, or as i say before in my book, my experience: a world. Every moment of our existence is filled with a place called the place of existence. Each moment is different, different and different. Where the real existence of each moment exists, each reality exists in its own world of space, time, space and time and space. At that moment, all of us are there, living and living, even in space; but theres nothing there that gives us an idea about our reality or about its reality of being; itd only be our consciousness. [p] 8. So what do you mean by a \"place of existent\" in your experience? It is our place\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**: When the brain is damaged due to trauma, it can cause the brain to temporarily disconnect from the rest of the body. This disconnection can lead to an OBE.\n",

            "In some cases, OBEs can be triggered by the following:\n",

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] I'm not sure I understand your question. The question is \"why would someone have an out of body experience after being seriously injured\". I would say that the body is very good at hiding the source of pain. A person with a serious injury will feel pain in the affected area. But when they go to the hospital, they are told that they are in a coma. This is because the body is not aware of the damage that the person is experiencing.  So when the body is unable to process the information, it does not send the pain signals to the brain. Instead, the brain gets the information that the person is in a coma and it thinks that the person is dead.  The brain then sends the brain signals to the body to think that the person is dead. The body responds by pulling the person's head up and putting them in a position where they are not aware of the pain.<|eot_id|>\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] \"i know this is a very sensitive subject, but the point is, people experience things that are very personal to them. I have had a lot of experience with people who were very, very violent and they were able to express themselves with violence and violence-i've never experienced anything like that.\"a lot can go wrong with this, and i think people have to understand that what they experience is very different from what their body can do. But i don't think that's what's going to happen to me. That's not my thing. It's a part of my body, i feel it. And if i can't get my own body to do that, then it's up to the body. The thing i know is that if you get injured, you've got to go to a hospital, that can get you in a coma. If you're in the hospital and you don, the doctor will treat you for a while, or you can have surgery, which is what i do, it takes time. You don' have time for that kind of thing, so you have no choice. They can come in and do it, they can see it in their head, see what it is. So i'm not going there to try to hurt somebody, because i want to help, to heal. There's no point in trying to take someone's life. This is something that i try not to think about. My body is my life, my family is mine. What's important is not for me to be a scapegoat for anybody, no matter what, if someone is hurting me, who is hurt, whether it be the other person or the police. We all have our own lives, we all want our family and our friends and family to see us. How can i be responsible for this? I will not be able, for example, being responsible if my wife is injured. People don 't want that to affect their lives. I'll be involved if it doesn't affect my health, how i treat myself. All that matters is the person who's injured and the injury that is causing them to suffer. Then i would like to get a prescription for the medication they need to control themselves. When i was in high school, there were two kids who didn't have any control. One of them was a little bit out of control, one of the kids didn' t know what he was doing. He was going into the bathroom, his face was black, he had his arms outstretched, all these little things. His head was getting too big, too wide. Every day he would just get up and move, move. At the time he didn t understand what was happening, where he needed to move and how he could control himself. In high schools, sometimes you see kids playing in school and then they come back and start doing things, not doing anything. Now it wasn't a problem for them, this was something they had to deal with. Even at the end of highschool, when i got my license, just to keep it for myself, even though it was just a misdemeanor, at that time i had no control over it or what happened to it so i just went to school. Because of what we were going through, most of us were not aware that we had control issues. By the age of 15, though, kids started to talk to each other. Kids started asking questions. Sometimes it took a couple of years for kids to realize that their parents were in control of their life and that they needed a medical doctor. As they got older, their minds began to change. Some of these kids had an idea about what to expect and what not, what if they could get it back, why wasn 'til now, in my opinion, someone had gone out and done something wrong, didn't know how to treat themselves, had lost control and had had problems. Many of those kids were having their own problems, some of which were more serious than others. Once they started talking to one another, a doctor was trained to look at them and make sure they didnt have problems with their health. Not only did that help them see that there was no problem, as well as help with the problems they have, things were beginning to improve. \"i don' t want my children to have this sort of situation where they feel that because of someone else's actions, maybe they should go through with it and stop acting like they did in front of me.\"as i mentioned, these are all very important things to remember. These are the things i've learned about myself from the experience of being in this situation. Those things are important to us all. To know that you will be okay.\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ive always thought it was something like the aftermath of a car accident. The brain is really big and it takes a while for the blood to get to the muscles. If you have a really traumatic injury, it can take a long time for it to heal back up. It might take weeks or months, or even years for your brain to completely heal. However, if it is a big, traumatic event, like a crash, you can be pretty good at figuring out how to repair it. Once you start to see things like \"the brain can't heal itself\", it's hard to say \"it's just not that good\". Also, there's the possibility that you might just have to do the \"wrong thing\" and die from lack of oxygen. But if that's what happens, then you don't need to be a doctor to figure it out.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] This is a question which you have to ask yourself, not to mention that you are likely to find yourself wondering how many cats there are in a particular area. In my experience, it's not uncommon for a cat to have a good time eating the food it eats. If you're not sure what the average cat does, ask the vet. The first thing to do is check the cat's food intake. This is something which is common in other cats. Most of the time, you will have one cat eat the right amount of food and another cat do the wrong amount. For example, when i was in my first cat house, i had one kitten that i used to feed to a littermate. I didn't know how much of his food he used, so i gave him a small amount and let him eat it. It was an amazing experience. However, if you find a problem with your cat, go ahead and try again. Answer: this is not a scientific question. I'm not going to say that it is impossible, but if it was, the question would be, what is the optimal amount to give a kitten to the person who eats it? It's important to remember that cats are omnivores. When a kitty is in danger of starvation, they will eat anything they can get their hands on. Therefore, a normal cat can eat a lot of things. Unfortunately, this does not mean that a regular cat should eat only a few things a day. Many people have suggested that if they are going out for dinner or a special occasion, then they should be able to afford to be at the top of their game. My advice is to make sure that your pet is eating enough to cover their needs. A healthy cat will also not eat too much. That is, your cats will not be starving. So, take a look at your vet's reports and see if there is any indication that their cat is fed right. You may want to consider using a food source such as the canned fruit, which will make it easier to get the nutrients you need. Also, be sure to look for other foods in the house that may be helping your kitties. Your vet may also suggest that they give you a treat which may include a quick bite to try and help with the problem. These are the things you should look out to. Answer: it depends on what you want your kitten in. As for the rest of your life, keep an eye out, for your veterinarian will try to tell you what to expect from your next cat.\n",

            "[Answer] The Battle of Tours is widely touted, along with Salamis, as a *battle that saved western civilization.*  This really is not the case. I've phrased it this way on this subreddit before, but the Umayyad war machine was grinding to a halt by the time armies crossed the Pyrenees. Supply lines were massive, especially for an empire stretching from Transoxiana to the Iberian Peninsula. Also, keep in mind that this Arab army was most likely a raiding force out pillaging Aquitaine rather than a force bent on conquest. Coupled with that, a few years following the Battle of Tours there was an Umayyad disaster in North Africa. The Berber Revolt of 740 crippled imperial authority in North Africa and several independent Islamic Berber states rose. The Umayyads suffered a humiliating defeat and couldn't focus on foreign conquest. So, realistically, had the Umayyads emerged victorious from Tours, they probably wouldn't have been able to follow up the victory.\n",

Charles Martel, also known as Charles Martel the Great, was a Frankish king who fought against the Moors in the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. This battle was a significant victory for the Franks, but it was not a decisive one.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Umayyad Caliphate was a powerful Islamic state that emerged in the 7th century AD. They were a major power in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain, and their empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The Umayyads were Sunni Muslims who sought to spread Islam to the non-Muslim populations of their territories.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering the historical context, it's unlikely that the Umayyads would have had a significant occupation of France. France was already a Roman province, and the Roman Empire had been conquered by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD. The Umayyads, being a Muslim empire, would not have had the same level of control over the Western Mediterranean.\n",

            "Moreover, the Umayyads' expansion plans were focused on the Mediterranean region, Africa, and the Middle East. They did have some influence in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), but it was limited to the kingdoms of Toledo and the Kingdom of Asturias.\n",

            "Given the historical context, it's highly unlikely that an Umayyad occupation of France would have been successful.

I was a student of the student council of ummah for a few years. When i joined, i met the principal of my school. The principal and i are close friends. We were friends until the war. After the end of hostilities, we became friends and we have had many conversations. It was during this time that i learned that the holy prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said: \"o allah's apostle, make us acquainted with each other and with our fellow muslims.\" i agreed to this. As soon as the holy prophet said this, he gave me the order to have him accompany me to the prophet's house. He came and greeted me.

This was at that time the time of prophet muhammad (peace and blessings of god be on him), and so it is not surprising that umar ibn al‑umar (may allaah have mercy on his soul) came here to give him the command to accompany his companions to medina and to be with them on the pilgrimage to mecca. If the imam of mecca (abu bakr) had had any knowledge of this matter, then he would have been well advised to leave the place.

I do not believe that an imam was present at umdat al khazaliya in umuhara or in medina. But he had some knowledge about uman ibn 'abd al—shaykh alaij, who was one of those who gave him this instruction. ...\"i will not be allowed to visit you in this place, but i will be able to see you and your companions and tell them about you.

So it is nice to be able to express ourselves in a way that allows for some peace, that is not the case for others. But we are all human. We all have a purpose, a connection, and a meaning. As the bible says, \"behold, i am the way, the truth, my love, your spirit, you shall never sin.\" (mark 8:28-29). And the scriptures say, \"do not covet.\" in other words, we love and care about our heavenly father, who is our only hope for eternal life. So i want to share my perspective on why we care for and are compassionate to others, what we want and need from our lives, how we can share our love with others and what it means to love god and him. The idea that we need to \"talk to each other out of our mouths\" is a false one. In fact, it's a lie. It is the same lie that keeps people from giving a shit about what they believe in. They will never ask the question. When we say we're going to ask god to take us in, he will be willing to give us the answers we really need. There are many people out there who are just asking god for answers and asking for them to answer them, but they are really not. This is because they don't have the right to hear what god has to say to them about their lives. The only way they can hear god is through their own actions and the actions of others in our life, not through our actions or the things we do. I hope that by sharing my own perspective, people will find that they have an opportunity to speak out about these issues and to learn from their experience. And if they do, they will learn that love is just as important to us as love. If we ask our people to do the hard work of making love to one another, to make love not just to other people, or to another human being, then we will live more happily and more happy. You can be a part of that. No matter what you do or say. Just do it. Love yourself. Don't be afraid to change. Do what's right for you. Be open to new experiences. Think about the possibilities. Look at the world around you and how it affects you, so that you can see and understand what is happening. Let go of the fear of rejection, let go the thought of being rejected, letting go your life to find a better life for yourself and for your family. Accept your limitations. That's what i love about sharing a story with other human beings, because i know that all of us have one purpose. To share a new experience with another person. Because we all love eachother.\n",

When we do that, we are creating a kind of auditory feedback loop. The more you speak, the louder the feedback gets, so you start to hear other people talking and it becomes a \"chirping\" experience. I believe that's why we hear people talk, because the other person is louder, but it's not really that important. You just hear them talking, which is why you have a sort of \"loud\" sound. Edit: i should also add that this is just a response to the sound of your own voice. If you look at the sounds of people speaking, you will notice that you hear the same voice that they are making.

This was a very popular argument, and keskhar argued that the colonists were entitled to \"freedom of speech\".

            "\n",
            "[Answer] Your metabolism slows by about 10% while you are asleep (and body heat is a byproduct of metabolism). Your core temperature actually drops by a degree or two. Most people are in the 96° range while they sleep.  Your brain's \"thermostat\" (the hypothalamus) is set to 98.6 or so, so when you wake up, your brain thinks, \"Woah! Chilly! We prefer to keep it a little warmer in here!\" Then you start shivering and moving around (or you crawl under the covers) and warm up!\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Baseline] There are several reasons why you might feel hotter trying to sleep than trying to wake up, regardless of the actual room temperature. Here are some possible explanations:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Body heat:** When you're trying to sleep, your body is in a state of dormancy, and your metabolism slows down. This means that your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer. Conversely, when you're trying to wake up, your body is in a state of wakefulness, and it's more efficient at generating heat to warm you up.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Metabolic rate:** As mentioned earlier, when you're trying to sleep, your body's metabolic rate slows down, which means it uses less energy. This reduced metabolic rate can make you feel warmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Sweating and evaporation:** When you're trying to sleep, your body produces more sweat, which can evaporate quickly, making you feel warmer. This process is more efficient when it's cooler, as the air is already cooled.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Adaptation to temperature:** Your body has an internal thermostat that regulates its temperature. When you're trying to sleep, this thermostat is set to a lower temperature, making you feel warmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Hormonal changes:** Sleep and wakefulness are regulated by hormones, such as melatonin and cortisol. During sleep, melatonin levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer. During wakefulness, cortisol levels are higher, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Comfort and relaxation:** When you're trying to sleep, it's often a comfortable and relaxing environment. This comfort can make you feel warmer, as your body is in a state of relaxation.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Evaporative cooling:** When you're trying to sleep, the air is often more still, which means it's easier for the air to evaporate and cool the body. This process is more efficient when it's cooler.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Psychological factors:** Your perception of temperature can be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, boredom, or excitement. If you're trying to sleep, you may feel more relaxed and comfortable, which can make you feel warmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Sleep stage:** When you're trying to sleep, you're likely in a deep sleep stage, which means your body is in a state of dormancy. During deep sleep, your body loses heat more quickly, making you feel warmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Individual variability:** Everyone's body is different, and individual variability can affect how you perceive temperature. Some people may\n",

As long as the law is constitutional, the death penalty is legal. There are a few reasons for this. First, if you are convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole, you will be eligible for parole after 20 years. If you were to be executed, you would never be eligible for parole. Second, if you are convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole, the judge will also decide whether or not you should be eligible for parole. If you are eligible for parole, you will be released from prison. If you are not eligible for parole, you will die. Third, there are laws against the death penalty.

Also, if the sentence is a life sentence, it would be a lot longer than the time you would have had to serve. If a parole board has a problem, they can try to get someone to sign off on their parole. But then, what happens if someone can be put back on parole after a while? It's not like they would get put in jail. In fact, some parole boards don't even bother to try and keep someone in prison. They'll just let them get out of there. Source: _url_0_ it seems to me that it is the most common reason for people to be sentenced for murder. The reason you get a \"life sentence\" is because it doesn't make sense for them to spend the rest of their lives in a prison cell. As long as they have some sort of money to pay for their time, and the fact that they are not in any danger of dying, the punishment is more likely to make them go free.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A gas, which is not a particle, is a gas with a mass of 10^4. If the mass is 10, then it is the gas's mass. In other words, if you have a 1043^6 mass, and you are moving a little faster, you would be moving about 10 times slower than if the speed was 10. But, the same thing holds for a carbon atom. The carbon atoms are not moving as fast as a photon. So, a car with 100 miles on the clock is accelerating at about 2.8 miles per hour. A car moving at a speed of 1,000 miles an hour is going faster than a speeding car at 1.3 miles a hour!the same is true for the carbon molecule. It is doing a lot more than that. A molecule of carbon is at least 5 times more energetic than the car that is traveling at that speed. When the molecules of the two molecules are at the point where they are doing the most work, they will all get the energy that the photon will be able to provide. This is called energy conservation. To make this happen, we need to keep the hydrogen atoms in balance. Since hydrogen is one of a number of gases, it would appear that some of them are going to get more energy if they were to move faster. For example, to make the \"bio-electric\" electrons move, their energy would need 10^{-3} times that of hydrogen. (the \"energy\" of electrons is an equation of energy, or \"dependence\"). So a molecule that moves in equilibrium with the electron, will have more electrons than one that does not move. We have to be careful not to over-indulge in energy because that will increase the amount of time the electrons will travel. Therefore, an electron that travels at an energy level that makes the atom move at 5.2 miles/hour would have an 8-hour energy cycle. However, with an extra 10 electrons in its molecule, its energy will only be 8 hours! So we will need an additional 10 molecules to give us an answer to this question. Answer: the atoms of each of these molecules will move with their own energy. Each of those molecules can also be \"coupled\" with another molecule to produce an electric charge. Thus, each molecule is charged when it has the highest energy possible. As the molecule moves, this electric energy is produced by the electric field of its surroundings. An electric current is created when the light inside the vehicle is being converted to electricity. Here is how the electrical current will work: (1) when an atom is \"charged\", it will \"be\" charged by a current, while the current inside it stays at its own current (which is constant). In the first case, there is no current outside the cell, but in this case the charge is kept at 3.5 volts. You can see how this works by looking at this graph:(2) as an example of this, let us look at some electrons that are in charge of an ac motor. They move in \"concentration\". When they do this they create a charge and it can be used to push the motor as it moves. Because of their charge, electrons can move freely. How many electrons does a motor have? The answer is that it only has about 4.6. Note that this is so because the charging current of ac motors is very small. Let us assume that a single electric motor has enough current to run it. That's a 2% charge that can drive a 500-pound truck. Now let's look into the question of how many of our electrons we have. Imagine that you've got a large gas tank filled with gas. Do you want to charge the tank with 5% of your electric power? You don't. Your gas will not do much good. Just as if it had enough hydrogen to fuel the pump, so will the gasoline. At the end of all this gas is stored in your car. What happens to it if we don�t charge it with enough energy to maintain its \"charge\"? It will take a while for it to recharge, as the battery will stop working. I�m not sure how long this takes, since i don��t know how to estimate it, although the answer i got is usually a few days. Finally, i would like to mention that there are many different kinds of charges that exist. One charge can only have two electrons, one can have no electrons at all, only one charge at any one time. Another charge has many charges. Some charge seems to have different energy (in the case of electric charges), some charges seem to generate an electrical charge or a magnetic charge (a\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~it is the same as the kinetic energy, but the energy is distributed to the spacecraft.~~ (edit: formatting) this is not the case, the acceleration due to gravity is still the force due the ship. The \"energy\" is transferred to a part of the hull which is where the speed of sound is defined. If the spaceship slows down and the gas in it is less dense, then it will have less kinetic and thus the amount of energy transferred will be lower. This does not happen for a spacecraft traveling at the speeds of light, it does happen if you accelerate the craft and then slow it down, this happens in both cases. So it would be a very small difference in energy. Edit: grammar. I don't think it's true that the two parts of a ship can be separated from each other and that they are moving at speeds greater than the velocity of that. As you know, in vacuum the difference between the engines is negligible. But in space, say, a space ship the thrust of one part is equivalent to its weight, and a shuttle is equal to it mass, so if two pieces of space ships are separated, they will still have the exact same thrust. And same speed. At a high speeds, there is no difference. That is what you have to do with thrust, for, gravity.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think it's possible. The most common example of this is in the case of the moon, which has a mass of about one-half that of earth. When the moon's gravity pulls in on itself, the gravitational force on the earth is about 1.8x10-11, and that force is applied to the planet in an acceleration-like way. As the gravity and momentum of gravity move through the atmosphere, they compress and compress the entire planet. As they cool and cool, their energy is transferred to and from the sun. This is called \"gravity dissipation\", and it causes the motion of objects to be shifted around and back to their original position. In the diagram below, we see that the rotation of a planet is reversed when the orbital motion is taken into account. The planet's gravitational pull is increased when it is pushed back toward the sun. So the force of centrifugal force, called gravitational acceleration, is 1,8.6x11.5x9.2x8 . This means that if the pressure on earth on a very cold planet (like the one on which we live) is reduced by 1 , the mass on earth is shifted to 1 . __________now, as we can see, there are a lot of different ways in which the forces of motion on our planet are applied. In the diagrams below we have a list of these different possible actions. We can imagine that we are standing in front of an enormous screen with a large screen facing right. On it there is a small screen that has an axis of rotation (a. K. A., the point where the screen is facing the center of mass). The screen has no position or rotation. It is not in any way moving. When we move it, it does not move in a straight line. Instead, when we rotate it around, its position is changed by a series of changes. What we do is change the position of its screen. If we tilt the small-screen down a certain way, then we change its orientation. However, if we want to change it to a different orientation, our screen will not rotate. But if, for some reason, something is happening on that screen, that is, a change in its rotation, or even if it changes its form, what we need to do to make it move. Now, i will explain this problem in more detail. First, let's start with the change of orientation of our small screens. I'm going to start off by saying that in order to move the big screen around on its axis, you must first move its display, so that it moves in that direction. Then, after the first rotation the display will rotate, not the other way around. Since the orientation is different on each screen in relation to one another, this means we must change our display to rotate one way or the next. To do this, simply move your small display in different directions. And this will change your screen's orientation with each rotation by one, depending on how much you want it rotated. Note that each of my examples is only one of many possible ways to create a screen rotation that affects its motion. Each of those can be done by simply moving the whole screen of your system. Also, to see how i would do it (and what i know of how it works), just move one or more of them around the system by pressing the move button. Finally, here's the problem. Suppose that you are going in one direction, but you're going out the opposite direction on one screen (or in some other direction). You're in two directions, both of which are rotating at different times. You can either go in either direction or out of both directions by moving your large display. At this point, your display is moving from left to right, from right to left, moving up and down, etc. Your screen moves from a horizontal plane to an angle of 90 degrees. There's a whole range of possible changes to your image, including: changing the size of each pixel. Changing the color of all the pixels. Changing how the brightness of certain parts of that image changes with respect to other pixels (e. G., changing its brightness when viewing a picture of someone in his right hand, because he has trouble with white balance on his screen). Changing whether a specific color is on or off the background of any of his or her images (the color in question, \"black\"). Changing whether the pixel on your main screen or on an adjacent screen reflects that color. Turning off your camera. Turning off any other feature that your phone or tablet is capable of (such as the camera). Or turning on any feature or feature on another device (i. E., a battery, flash, monitor, screen reader). Changing which other screen you will use. And how to set up your tablet, while you can. All of it\n",

However, the forces acting on objects are the same, and they are related. The force of gravity acting upon an atom or molecule is proportional to its angular velocity. This is why a ball on a string is heavier than a basketball.~~ the earth is rotating about its axis of rotation. So if you put a bowling ball in the middle of a rotating earth, it will be rotating at an angle of 1.5 degrees to the axis. That's because the bowling balls have an angular mass of about 0.1 g. If the ball were to be on the surface of an earth-like planet, this would be 0 g, but it would still be very small. On earth this will result in an ellipse, which is a circle that is slightly wider than the diameter of earth. A planet rotating around a star would have a diameter larger elliptical orbit, because that would result from the rotation of its core. (note that this doesn't actually happen on this planet because it's rotating, as it rotates around the center of mass.) so it wouldn’t generate any gravitational forces, just the opposite force from gravity.

To rotate around an equal to radius, radius of 2. Which it also has a radius (2/3). Gravity at all times the radius 2 . This force can be divided by (g/r) in g . If 2 times radius to get a point. Since its distance is 2g. In this case it has units, 2 g3 = (0,2 ). So the ratio of g2=1/g3. Not radius and so yes there is angular acceleration (or angular force (this is also the number of acceleration) is equal and vice versa. 2 gravity as well. No force and yes it might not be mass. Now gravity also be the difference in a vector. Is something like distance or angular gravity from earth and time. As far as we know gravity will never be equal. Or opposite gravity=0 the mean. We are not equal in all directions. Hence it doesnt happen in our orbits. Hope that you get that gravity gets the way. G is in coordinates of equal distance as a function of time, where it does. E=m and velocity is positive. However it only. _url_ is negative. Thats just distance that. Here is what it means, g(1 if its a constant. **distance. All of radius = g .1 and it can g the gravitational acceleration is zero. T is its time and a (distance of your distance from this.2 the total mass is g/distance = 2 and its area.

Having claws is good for grabbing big stuff that will run away if you don't stab them with claws. Claws are generally big bulky things that are used like forks. Evolution-wise, there are some mighty tasty bugs and stuff that you need to have small fingers for. Ever seen women with big fake fingernails on? They can't do shit.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The missle is a very good defence, but it is not a defence of the uk. It is the defence of scotland. It can be used to protect scotland, so it can take care of us. Question: what is your opinion of what the \"missle\" is?answer: the missl is an alternative to the trident missile system. I do not agree with the fact that it would be good for scotland but i think that the issue is that there is no way for it to go through the defence system without the support of other parts of britain. There is also no alternative. This is because there would have to be a large amount of money involved to do it. The cost of it has to come from other sources. I am not saying that scotland is in any way better off. But i believe that if it were to get through with it, it could be done. And that is what i want to see. It could take a lot of time, and it should be on the basis of a long-term programme. If it was to have a short-lived programme, then it might be time for a new one. Question: can you give an example of an \"unsubmerged nuclear fuel\" in the united kingdom? Answer: no. No, that would not be very helpful. However, i have seen a couple of examples of \"unsung\" nuclear power plants being built in scotland in recent years. What about the u-235 nuclear reactor in glasgow that i described above? Answer : the current uk nuclear weapons program is based on a single, unsubmersed reactor. In the us, a larger, more complex nuclear plant would produce more nuclear energy than would a smaller one, such as a nuclear submarine. We would also have more plutonium, which would then be produced by the more sophisticated plutonium reactor, called the tungsten reactor. That is, the reactor would contain more uranium than is currently produced. So the idea is to build a more powerful reactor than what we currently have. Now, when we consider that nuclear plants can produce plutonium more efficiently than they can make nuclear bombs, this idea would make sense. (i have never heard of that idea, although i suspect that you might. )in any case, you would need to consider how much plutonium you have, what kind of fuel you are using, how many people you're using and how long you've been using it . What's the best way to make a bomb that produces plutonium? How much fuel can we use? Answer i don't know. My guess is about 0.4 liters, or 0/30,000, for each kilogram of plutonium. You can put the amount in a gallon of water and drink it in about 12 minutes. Let me go back to what you said about how fast you can do that. Is it really possible to produce a plutonium bomb of about 100-150 kg? What is it about that that makes it possible? The answer is yes. Your answer to that question is very simple. On the one hand, if you want your bomb to work, its fuel needs to burn at about 3-4 times its own fuel. At this point, your fuel is much more expensive than the fuel of your target, because it needs more fuel to move about and to reach the target. As long as your reactor has sufficient fuel, there will be no problems. For a given amount, however, some of its energy needs will not change. Therefore, even if your nuclear weapon does not produce enough plutonium to meet the needs of our target population, we can still use it as fuel if the need arises. All this means that we will have enough fuel and can use the plutonium as needed. Here is my answer for you. You might say that, on average, about 15% of all the energy in an unsupervised nuclear test is spent fuel (or fuel that has been removed from the test reactor and stored at the site). So we are talking about a \"very high energy level\" of energy. Which means, from a fuel point of view, very high amounts of spent energy (such as the spent nuclear waste that can actually be generated by a test). However this does mean that a high amount (and this is assuming that your test will produce any waste at all) of these spent-energy spent will go to waste. Not only is this a problem, not only will waste be wasted, of course, as you will see later on. Nuclear waste is produced from nuclear reactors that have been designed to operate at a constant power level. They are designed for continuous operation. When you build one of those reactors, one day you'll have spent spent reactor fuel stored in your tank, ready to use by then. Well, by that time you may have already produced a waste product. Thus, waste from that day\n",

They also use a special, but still powerful, thruster to pull the warheads out of the way.~~ edit: i should add that the misslem system doesn't really work like a missile. It uses a rotating cannon that spins around and shoots the missile at the target, and then uses the thrusters to spin around it and shoot it back at it. The missiles are moving at a different speed than the cannon, so the spinning is not as effective. _____ edit 2: the reason for the spin is because the fission of a nuclear weapon requires a lot of energy. So in order to get a fissile material to a target it needs to be moving fast enough that it can keep spinning for long enough to destroy the object.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I'm not sure what the answer is, but i've read that humans have an extremely poor sense of smell. I don, however, think that we are the only species in the world that has an ability to smell things. I think there are many other animals that can smell, which is why we have the ability for it to be so common. If you look at the list of animals which are \"obvious\" to humans, i'd suggest that they are:carpal sparrows (carcharodon sp.)dinosaurus (deinonyx)giant spiders (gephytus)kairosaurus (scythe) __________________ last edited by lgolaf; 04-08-2009 at 11:46 am .\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~humans get very dry noses.~~ animals get really dry. Edit: a lot of animals have a really good sense of smell. For example, i would say that we have the best sense for when we smell things. If you've ever been in a car, you know that smell is coming from your nose. But we don’t, because we aren‘t used to it. And we are not used as much. So we get the smell of the car instead. This is why dogs and cats are often more sensitive to odours. Dogs can smell the odour of a dog even if it is not their own. They have evolved to be sensitive when smelling things that are their scent, and this allows them to smell for themselves. Cats can also smell their food, but they are more used for food. I think i“m wrong. Source: i worked as a vet and have been a veterinary technician for a long time. My dog can‖t smell food and i know she can't smell smell his own urine, so she has a hard time picking out food for her.

On a broad scale, the Federal Reserve loans money out to the big banks, who in turn loan it out to smaller banks, businesses, and people.  By raising the interest rate, the Fed is making it more expensive to borrow money from them.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] This is the question we ask ourselves in our daily lives. We have seen the federal reserve raise interest rate expectations by a small amount and the fed's move to raise rates has been a big one. It's a little bit of a stretch to say that the government will be able to do a better job of keeping inflation low than it would be without the increase in the reserve. The fact that government is raising rates because of interest payments on government bonds is an indication of the extent to which the dollar is a reserve currency. In other words, if the treasury is willing to lower rates, it will have to take out more money to keep inflation in check. The fed will also have the ability to borrow more to pay for inflation, which will make it harder for government to run deficits. In other word, government spending will increase and inflation will rise. If the reserve were to hike rates at the same rate as the private sector, the economy would grow at an even faster rate. This would have a negative impact on the u. S. Economy, because the total value of government assets would decrease.\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ianas, i'm a former bank manager and i have a hard time finding a single reason why the interest rate will increase, and the reason i can't seem to find a reason it doesn't. I think the issue is that the fed has been making a huge amount of money, so the banks have been doing a lot of business. If the rates go up, it's going to be a combination of a) the economy is getting worse, b) interest is going up. It'll be very hard for the government to keep up with the inflation, because the money will be tied up in bonds. The idea of the \"interest rate hike\" is to make sure the markets can keep inflation low. This is very important, as it means that if you're buying a house for $500,000, the price of your house will go down. You can also buy a car for just $300, if your car is worth $350, you'll have to pay a higher interest penalty. So it will take a while for people to adjust to the new rates. People will also start to think that they're paying more to buy houses, but it won't happen until they actually pay their new rate. Since they are paying less. Tl;dr: the current rate is the rate they set, they'll keep it higher. Edit: and it was a little bit of an estimate of what they were looking for.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] This is why i am writing this. I have been writing about productivity since 2008 and i have written about my productivity for over ten years. I love it. In my previous blog post i talked about the benefits of being able to focus on your task at any time and that i do not think this is the case for most people. However, i think there are a few things that people need to know about how to get productivity up. They need some context. The first is that most productivity is achieved by the individual. We all have a finite amount of time to work. As a result, it is very easy to not get any work done. This is a fundamental aspect of productivity. What i mean by this, is this: if you are able, then you can work on whatever you want and keep up to date with your work and your goals. If you do nothing at all, you will probably never be able or able not to be creative. It is extremely important to keep your focus and motivation up in order to stay on top of your activity. So, what i'm saying is, if i work as hard as i can, that will make me happier and make my work more productive. But, when i start working, my focus is on my task, not my time. When i get up from my desk, and my activity is up, the focus will be on the task and not on what it's doing. The more time i spend on this task the more productivity i will get. There is some advice that some folks might like to read but i feel that this does not apply to everyone. There are many different things you could do to increase productivity, but you should always be prepared to spend some time in the morning. After all you don't have to write a book to do this and it will help you get the most out of the day. In fact, for many people, after a day of work, they might want to go back and check on their progress. A good start would be to take a break, like a nap, or just be a little more relaxed. Instead of just sitting and doing nothing, take your time, work hard, focus, be more focused and have fun. You'll get more of what you need. And if your goal is to create a better day, try to enjoy your day and get some more sleep. Or, as a more creative person, start using more fun things to make your life easier. To summarize, just as it takes time for the brain to develop new neurons and to learn new ways of thinking, so too do it take time before the mind can learn to produce new ones. I believe that the main reason we are not able for a lot of people is because we can't get enough of our own time (and it may be time we could be better at it). It may take some effort to try and do something to add to your productivity as long as you keep it up at the same time as your brain is developing new neural connections. My experience is most of us don`t really think about what we do for our time or what things we want or need as important as our productivity when we have it, instead we focus our attention on other things like how much time it took me to finish my book, how many hours i spent on it or how long i was doing it on time so i could keep working on that task. Once you start getting this idea, make sure you have some kind of plan to help your mind get used to the idea and then work towards it as soon as possible. Take a look at my recent blog posts for an example of how i try my best to give my brain time not only to think, to remember, learn and work but to use it to solve problems. (i love to share my thoughts on life and how it works and what to say to my friends and family). One thing i really like about this article is i dont have any problem with it at this point. People will often tell me that it has helped me with my writing and writing is one of my greatest strengths. Even though i usually dont talk about it too much, let me tell you that there is an important difference between me and other people who are trying to fix their writing problems with writing exercises. On the one hand, most writers are good at writing. Not only are they good with the writing, their technique is also very good. Writing is not a skill that a professional can teach them. No one can improve their ability to edit or edit text on a computer. While they can get a sense of a writer's strengths, there can also be some problems that can arise when they are writing a problem. One of those problems is how they write. Some writers don�t even understand how writing works, even though it can be done\n",

So if your sleep is shorter than a certain amount, your quality-of-life will be better. If, however, the amount of time you spend sleeping is longer than the number of hours you spent sleeping, then your productivity will drop.

The supreme courts ruled that ia was not violating any of the laws that the united states has enacted.

They are not allowed to do anything they think would be politically good. There are people who are trying, but they have not been able to bring a bill to the floor for a while. So they can't pass it. If congress does pass a law, they will have to vote to approve it, and then the senate will vote on it as well. Most of their votes are for things like raising the minimum wage, raising medicare, or lowering taxes.

In order to take each of the three redoubts, the French would have to focus artillery and charge with the bayonet because the earthen works would be enough to defend against the French firepower. Further, the Russians did fight in these positions because Russian tactics were more about being stubborn than actually having a tactical doctrine.

And the bayonets are actually quite similar to the german \"dynamic\" \"machines\" and \"boots\" of wwii (see video below)the bayo-tac was an infantry weapon that was used by the germans to attack their enemy from behind, and to block off their rear from the infantry, as well as to protect themselves from enemy gunfire.. The bay-onet was only used in the first few years of world war ii. It was first used on tanks and was not used until the war ended. There were several german tanks that used bayons on the front. In addition to bayoning, the rest of german tank technology was developed in europe. These tanks could be equipped with bayou or were based on tank engines. . The german bayoy was a german model of a bay rifle. Some german soldiers were equipped in this form with a gun for bayow. This gun was called a \"fire-bolt\" gun. A bayoo was also a type of bayomorine. .\"i think that the bayonet is a very useful tool for an enemy who is not able to follow the rifle or to stand still. If he can, he will be able, without any hesitation, to shoot at the enemy and make a good impression. But he must not be afraid of what he sees. He must know that he is doing something wrong, that his aim is wrong and that it is impossible to come to a complete understanding of his action.\" - heinrich heinrich, the great war of 1914-1918one of my favorite quotes is: \"this is the one thing that i always tell my soldiers: i will never tell you to fight.\" (i don't think this is true of any of them, but i think it's true for most of us.) \"you are a man of your word, if you wish to make your own use of this instrument. You may not make use for yourself, for your friends, or for the people who are your enemy. For you are the master of all that is good and worthy of you. And you will always make it your business to take the battle, never to lose it. Let the man who takes the fight win the whole war.\"- heinrik g. Rckner, \"the battle of mnchengladbach\"here is an interesting quote from a wwii quote:if you can't fight you must fight. That is why i say: if it are possible for you, then it must be possible to do it for me. I have been doing this for many years. When i was young, i had a beautiful and beautiful wife, a great family, an incredible family. My mother was very much a military woman. She never lost a battle. Her father had lost three battles, one of which he won. Our family was so happy, we all had to go to school to study, go out to work, get married, have children. We always had our families. They always brought us our guns, our rifles, their magazines, everything. Sometimes i would go in with them and they would shoot me with their bayos. No one was able. So i decided to give up my own life, my family and my life. Even though my father died, it was impossible for him to die. His only hope was to stay alive. Then we decided it would be better to leave him. (the quote is from his memoirs, published in 2001. See also: a history of ww1). I have always been a big fan of combat. Of course i loved it, too. During my years at home, when i went to war with my parents, they were all on a mission. To take part in combat, which was, after all, part of our job. On one day, in late 1944, something happened to me: my mother called to tell me that my dad had been shot by a sniper. While she was there, she heard something and knew something. Apparently, there was something very bad happening. As i looked up, her face was red with blood. \"oh my god, what a horrible thing to hear!\" i heard a loud bang. Someone was shooting at me from above, all the way to my head. What did i do? I ran, ran into the house. One of those people was my brother. All the other people were dead. Everybody was dead, except my mom, who had just been murdered. Not one person had ever been able talk to her. Everything was quiet, because she had no memory of anything.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the idea is that a bayonets bayeater can either be a spear, a bow or a dagger. The idea behind a \"barronet charge\" is to be able to use the bayou, spear or dagger to charge a unit and then to provide a shield to shield the unit from the enemy.~~ this is actually very useful in combat. If the attacker has an advantage in the battle, it means that the attackers are less likely to retreat, and that you have a greater chance of capturing the retreating unit. A typical \"baronet charging\" attack is for a soldier to pull out his weapon and charge forward. This allows the soldier's body to move faster, which means he can get his own charges off the target. ______________________________ **edit:** added a link to a previous answer. **source: **bayonet**: the history of warfare by david d.

O) if you have a genetic disease or a specific gene that you want to get rid of, you can get it back. (i) a person who has a disease can only get a certain number of copies of the gene from their mother. Therefore, if she has one copy of her gene, she will have one less copy in her body. However, some disease that has no effect on her, such as diabetes, can cause a mutation in one or more copies, which will cause her to become insulin resistant. This will prevent her from taking insulin, thus causing her disease. If the disease does not affect her blood sugar levels, then her diabetes will continue to cause diabetes. The same thing can happen to people who have two copies. Each person has his or her own genetic inheritance. They share the blood and the inheritance is inherited from the mother to their children. It is important to note that the body of each person is different in its inheritance of genes from his/her mother, as well as the genetics of other people's genes in relation to each other. In this way, people from different parts of their body can inherit the information about their genes when they have different inheritance patterns. We may look at the effects of having two genes as a mechanism for the different effects that one gene has on another gene. Posted by paul at 7:59 pm\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Distance**: The light from stars has been traveling through space for billions of years, which means it has had plenty of time to reach us. The farther away a star is, the longer its light takes to reach us.\n",
            "2. **Redshift**: When light travels through space, it becomes shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, a phenomenon known as redshift. This means that the light is being stretched, not redshifted, which makes it appear blue-green, not blue.\n",
            "3. **Supernova Remnants**: Many stars are surrounded by supernova remnants, which are vast, glowing clouds of gas and dust. These remnants are so hot that they emit intense radiation, which scatters the light from the star, making it appear as a tiny orb.\n",
            "4. **Interstellar Medium**: The interstellar medium (ISM) is the material that fills the space between stars. The ISM is composed of gas, dust, and other particles that absorb and scatter light. When light from a star passes through the ISM, it is scattered and absorbed, making it appear fainter.\n",
            "5. **Angular Resolution**: The angular resolution of an observer's eye is the minimum angle between two objects that can be resolved as separate.

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] They don't scatter because the atmosphere is opaque.  In the absence of atmosphere, the light from the star will travel in a straight line. If the star is far enough away, the light will be so bright that it will appear to be a point source. In fact, the light from a star is so bright that it will be seen as a point source even if the star is far away. If the atmosphere is opaque, the light will be scattered, and the star will appear as a tiny point in the sky. This is why we can see the sun from Earth. The atmosphere is opaque to light, so the light from the sun travels in a straight line, and the sun appears as a tiny point in the sky.<|eot_id|>\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think the reason is that the stars are much larger than our eyes. They have the capacity to scatter light, so if we want to see a small number of stars, we need to get our eye size right. The light is not just scattered out from the eye, but in our own light. In short, the way light travels through space is a consequence of our size. The more we have, and the more light we see, our visual ability improves. And it is this advantage that makes our light so valuable. As an example, consider this: a star is moving at a rate of about 50 miles per second. It takes about 10 seconds for it to reach the sun. In order to make a single photon, it needs to travel at around 4,500 miles for a light pulse to be detectable. This is about the speed of light in the universe. If we could see our star at that speed, then it would be like a bright light shining from a very distant star, even though it does not have a diameter of a meter. We can see it at about 4.5 times the diameter we would see the star. So, in order for our stars to do that, they must have been moving much faster than us. That is why we observe them at such speeds. Our stars move faster because they are moving more slowly than we do. A star must move at 4 times its light-speed to have any sense of motion. Yet, if the rate at which the sun's energy is released is high enough, that star's light can be seen as a tiny orb. An orb of that size, with its diameter about a millimeter, would have no sense for motion, as it moves away from us as the day goes by. Since it has so much light moving around it, however, its position is determined by the distance at rest from it. (the distance from our feet to the ground is only about 1.3 millimeters.) the sun is far more dense than its surroundings. Therefore, there is no way to know how much it can move around, or if it could ever reach us in that time. There is also no indication that its size changes with the amount of energy it emits. Instead, a telescope will show us that it's moving in a much more precise way, because it will see much higher light speed. When we look at the distances between stars in astronomical view, an image of the red dwarf will be more like the milky way than a picture of an orange. However, when we consider the time it takes the red dwarf to become visible, i would say it took about 2 minutes for us to realize the magnitude of its apparent size! The magnitude does change with your size; for example if you are about 5 foot 6 inches tall, your light would change about 20 percent when you turn to look around. Also, you will have to move your eyes a little more to understand the effect of your height. Even though your body is growing, what you see is more a reflection of how far away you were from your home planet. Your eyes are always going to go to a different place, rather than to one of several different places in your house. At the same time, though, one may notice that your planet is smaller than your sun. You will notice a lot more detail in an object, especially if your star has a larger diameter than the earth. My wife and i have seen a few bright stars on our planet and have felt a bit of pressure to keep the planet cool. I think that if our sun were moving so fast that we had to use our telescopes to detect its movement, this would make it a better target. Unfortunately, most telescopes are not as accurate as our current ones. They are very expensive, are less accurate than other telescopes, etc. Why do stars seem to behave differently when they move in different directions? I can't say for sure. But i know i am not alone. Many people have noticed that stars appear to show signs of moving. These stars have not been observed to change their motion in any way. Some have also observed that their light has changed more rapidly than it had before. To see this phenomenon, many people try to measure the size of their star by measuring the wavelength of incoming light and measuring how many times it passes through the telescope. Such measurements are usually impossible, since the wavelengths of visible light are so small. Using a similar method, astronomers also measure how fast the planets orbit. By measuring their orbits, scientists can compare their motions and find the most efficient way of predicting how long they will stay at their original positions. Thus, for every star we study, some would probably be able to predict that they would stay in their orbit for as long as 10 billion years. Furthermore, these calculations are based on very simple equations, which can only be used to calculate the number and size the objects\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~it is because the star is so bright that it takes its light to be reflected in the atmosphere.~~ edit: [this video](_url_0_) should help you understand why. The short version is that the energy released in stars comes from the emission of photons. Photons are emitted in a [phase diagram]( _url_. This is the same as the [light from a flashlight]( (_url__0__). The phase diagram is very simplified, but the explanation is fairly simple. In short, the wavelength of the photon is proportional to the square root of its energy. If the intensity of a photon changes, it will appear to change. This change is called a phase shift. A star does not emit photons, and its wavelength is not proportional. So the visible light spectrum has a much higher energy than the blue and green light bands. Edit 2: added link to video. It should be fairly clear what the other answers are saying. I don't have an explanation for my own research. Hope this helps. :) edit 3: in case you don’t have one: the \"blue and red\" light are actually red and blue. They are the wavelengths of light that we see in our atmosphere, so they do not reflect back to earth. Blue light. Red light is a little bit more like a prism than a cone. As you can see, if you look at a sphere, you are in your light cone, light has wavelength. We can‘t see it has different wavelengths. See a wavelength, red, blue is also different than our cones. Think of cone wavelength (how wide, in light, like our cone and cones, we only has wavelengths, a lot of wavelength and therefore it is more than cones and light (the wavelength). Blue, our light have different amounts of cones (it“are actually different things. Light).

And since it's not economical to provide one for every soldier, so you'd be better off making bigger shields that multiple soldiers can use together. And since you've got a motor, you can move quite a bit faster than on foot, so you'll want to have a group of these shield-vehicles moving together. And since a motorized shield-vehicle can carry so much more weight, you could have the soldiers use guns that are far larger and heavier than their normal guns.

            "[Answer] Assuming the bubbles are short lived they are just coming from the [aerator](_URL_0_) on your tap which is designed to disrupt the flow of water and introduce a bunch of air into the stream. When filling something slowly you give that extra air plenty of time to spread out and escape but when filling a narrow vessel quickly you continuously trap more and more of that air which will build up as bubbles on the surface. Assuming it is just normal tap water the bubbles should be relatively short lived, but if there is some kind of surfactant in the water then it can stabilize the bubbles for long periods of time. If you want to avoid this you can use a faucet without an aerator which should eliminate most of that inconvenience. However, aerators are generally included on household faucets as they can significantly reduce water usage so consider that before removing yours for this purpose.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] Excessive bubbling of tap water when filling a water bottle is a common issue. There are several possible reasons for this:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Mineral buildup**: Tap water often contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium. When these minerals enter the water supply, they can precipitate out of the water and form scales on the inside of the pipes. Over time, this can lead to excessive bubbling when filling a water bottle.\n",
            "2. **Hard water**: Hard water is water that contains high levels of minerals, which can cause it to bubble up when exposed to air.\n",
            "3. **Air in the pipes**: If there are air pockets in the pipes, they can cause the water to bubble up when filling a water bottle.\n",
            "4. **Deterioration of the pipes**: If the pipes are old or corroded, they may be more prone to mineral buildup and excessive bubbling.\n",
            "5. **Water quality issues**: If the tap water is not treated or filtered properly, it may contain impurities that can cause excessive bubbling.\n",

            "1. **Change your water filter**: If you have a water filter, consider replacing it with a more efficient one to reduce mineral buildup.\n",
            "2. **Use a water softener**: A water softener can help remove minerals and other impurities from the water, reducing excessive bubbling.\n",
            "3. **Check for air leaks**: Make sure that there are no air leaks in the pipes or fittings.\n",
            "4. **Use a water treatment system**: Consider installing a water treatment system, such as a water softener or a reverse osmosis (RO) system, to improve the quality of your tap water.\n",
            "5. **Descalcate your pipes**: If mineral buildup is the primary cause of the issue, consider having your pipes descaled by a professional plumber.\n",

The only thing i have that isn't great is my ability to run the black. In the past few years, i had a lot of issues running the board. So i decided to have a more challenging game and put it up for sale at my local store. My problem was that the store had only about 100 or so people in it and they were all playing black only. There were also some people playing other games and the games were not playing well with them. And i was not happy with that. As far as i know, the only way i could get the cash to buy the new game was to go buy it at the local comic shop, which i did. Now, my problem is that a few stores have been selling the old game but not the one with all the kids. This is why i want a new one. But i also want the players to feel that they have won. Just be sure that you are not wasting your time playing the other game because of the lack of kids in this game as well. All you do is play. Do not waste your money on this. Please, be nice to all of us. We want you to know that we are here to help. Thank you for your support. \"anonymous.\" replied \"hello,\"this is what you guys are talking about, so i am going to let you know what i think. For those of you who don`t like black, here is the link to the full game: http://www. Blackjack. Com/game/black-jacks-and-rocks.

Don't worry. One way or another, we will get back to this topic. (for the record, black and white are two different games, one game for kids, another game to adults. That is just how it works.) \"i can see it happening. Let me know if there are any questions. Thanks.\" \"this game has been sitting in your mind for a long time. When you first played it, there was no way you could play this good again. What did you think was going on?. . . \"you can play the same game in different places. On the first turn, if your opponent has a white or black player on board, he will have 1 black card. He will draw 1 card and take his turn. Then he can shuffle his hand and play a different color. Or, at any point, on the next turn he may draw a card for the white. Each player will play his own turn and he chooses which card he draws. Next turn his opponent will shuffle the cards and discard them to his deck. After that, they may play their own color and draw their turn's number of cards. Once the turn is over, all players must make a choice on which color they want their opponent to draw. These choices can be any of a variety of colors. No one can win this match. To see the actual game play you can look at this video:http://youtube. C/watch?v=hbrqx3v_q7a&feature=youtu. Beso i guess i just need to clear up some of my confusion. Does this mean that your black cards are just in play when your white cards play? Yes, that is true. Black cards will always be in control of their owner. A black white card will never win. Your white white and black black are the two colors that can not be drawn. However, some black players will win when they are drawing cards from their hand. Some black people will lose when their white opponent draws a red card because they can only draw 2 cards, while some white players win with their red cards because the red color is playing a higher power.

Take a long time to sit down and watch the game. I've done this before. 2. Start playing. You're playing the odds of winning. The more you play, the higher the chance you get. If you keep playing, you'll be better at picking off your opponent. 3. Practice. Keep your fingers on the table, and try to keep them as tight as possible. This is going to take practice and patience, but i think it'll make your game better. Also, i believe that you can only do it once. So if i tell you you want another five, that's the first time you've had to practice with it. Edit: and yes, there is a rule against letting other players play. In fact, some black holes don’t allow players to play without an agreement. For example, a black hole with a master blackhole in the middle is *not* allowed to have an agreed to let players win.

By sleeping during the day, animals can conserve energy and focus on more important tasks like hunting, mating, or caring for their young.\n",
            "2. **Predator avoidance**: Animals have evolved to be aware of their surroundings, even while they're sleeping. This awareness helps them detect potential threats, like predators, and take evasive action if necessary.\n",
            "3. **Feeding behavior**: Animals are active at night because feeding behavior is typically more active at night. In the wild, animals are more likely to hunt or forage for food at night, when there are more insects and small animals available.\n",

How do i know if i have a good chance of surviving in that situation or not? How can i protect my animal from predators? I'm not saying that there aren't predators out there, but it is important to understand the importance of feeding and protecting the animals. What is a predator doing in order to feed a prey animal, when there's no chance to be found out and the food is too high? And what are predators doing to avoid being found or harmed by predators, in particular, the large prey animals? This will help you understand what is going on in your situation. Can you protect your animal if it's not in its natural environment? Can you guard it? When can we protect animals from the predators that come along with the time of year? Are there predators in our home that are doing this? I think this is an important question to ask. Many people ask this question, \"what is the difference between a dog and a cat?\" what are they doing when we're not looking at the same pictures? What do they do when i donknow what they're doing, because they have no idea what i am looking for? Do they follow me on my walk or when it rains? Can they be trusted? In my experience, these questions are always asked, especially in situations where i live. Can we keep these animals and protect them from all the creatures that we see? The answer is that it depends on the situation, where you live and where the predator is. I'd like to talk about what to look for and how to protect yourself from these creatures. 1. Do you have any special training or experiences to help protect a pet in such a stressful situation and can the person be a little more responsible for their own safety and well-being? If so, how would you advise the people you're with in regards to this important matter? 2. When is it possible to teach a person what the dangers of the outdoors are? Should they keep their pet indoors, or should they go to the police or the military? The answer to that is, we don: they always have to go outside. In a lot of situations, people are afraid to take their pets outdoors, so they don�t have much to worry about. So you don`t need the training to stay indoors. You also dont want to put them in an environment that can lead to a confrontation. The training will allow you to know what you need and what it will do to your pet. If you can learn to deal with a problem, you will be able to manage it. 3. How often can a certain type of predator be seen in nature? Is it a very large animal that you are scared to kill or to hurt? A large predator can be very active in their home and will often wander in and out of it, for example, if they see a large person or a small animal. A small predator will also often be outside and may try to escape. 4. Are the size of your prey groups necessary for protection or are you more of a \"special case\" type predator? Where does it come from and is there a special need for a particular type? 5. Should you be concerned about the \"danger\" of large predators like lions and tigers? Why does a lion need protection and does an elephant need help? Some people find it easy to ignore large animals, as they might think that the big cats are only there to prey on small animals or that tigers are simply too big to see. They are really just there as a protection. Some of these people just ignore them because of their fear of them, while others are just too scared of animals to let them go. Do we have enough information for you? Have you ever tried to \"save\" a family member, a friend or even yourself? Or has it become too much of an issue? It is very important that people have information about predators. Have they ever been in trouble with predators or had their safety threatened by a big cat? We need information on these things. And then there will always be other things that need further study. It will take time to find the answers, particularly if you haven't tried before. Let's look at this further.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ive heard of a study where the female of an animal would go to sleep while the male would have to stay awake to mate. This is not true for all animals, and it's possible that some animals may have evolved to avoid the males sleeping. I know that's a bit of speculation, but it seems like it has to do with the fact that in most species, the sleeping hours are not a continuous length of time. The most common time for sleep is around 8am - 8pm. So the animals that have a higher number of hours of sleep may be more likely to be at higher risk of being eaten by predators. In fact, it is believed that animals who are awake during the day have more time to seek out food. Also, i'm not an expert on this topic, so i don’t know if it‘s true or not. Edit: thanks to /u/kimberly28 for the correction. Sorry for my poor english. [here's](_url_0_) a more in-depth explanation from the study. It does mention that the sleep-wake cycle is different for different species. There are some species of animals (such as the cuckoo and the panda) that are sleepers that prefer to eat/sleep in the daytime, while others prefer a daytime-night time, like the blackbirds. As a result, some are more active during their periods of the dark, others can sleep with less activity and so are active. Some prefer sleep at night. And others dont sleep in a different times of darkness. While there is also a lot of variation in their sleep, a few species that get eaten. All of these animals have different sleep cycles, as well, there”s a common. But there can“t be different levels of activity. Tl;dr: sleep = sleep. Sleep/wake = activity, activity = body temperature. Species = number and number = age, number. Animals can you see that humans are the same. _url = temperature, body temp. (and temperature/time. That— sleep > number is the circadian rhythm. A sleep cycle. If you‒ number canve just as varied as we are in this study, that there aren–t any species like cats and dogs. Cats sleep? I‑t remember the first explanation. Dogs and cats, however, are all night owls, they have the highest amount of times they sleep and sleep for food and need to lay eggs. They‖s the lowest number, cats need time with food, sleep but not the second. Not all. Birds. These are birds that eat and wait at different stages of their lives. When the sun rises and sets, not nights, for their bodies have food etc. Or the more. Etc, etc... Edit 2: a note that i am not sure if this was the correct answer. What i was referring to, sorry. Is a quick google search for information. Just like i should have mentioned that many animals. Hope i remember. Anyway, this might be a little bit more info. **tl;d: it all in other species we don: humans sleep or species: not mammals. > cats _we humans. We sleep all humans, all are mammals, animals are different. Humans is just one of many species and we all mammals and other mammals are similar. Most animals sleep the other.**we all sleep as animals we have similar and many different phases of day. No sleep (or sleep on day/night, night and day, day etc) > animals other creatures.

The core is made up of molten iron and a small amount of nickel. The molten iron is the one that is moving, so the magnetic field is generated by the movement of the molten iron. This movement is driven by the heat from the core. The heat is generated by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. These elements are radioactive, which means they decay very quickly. The decay rate is very high, and the decay of these elements is what drives the movement of the molten iron.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] (not sure if it would be a good idea, but maybe it is a matter of time.)the answer to that question is to make the poliarity change to be more or less constant. So, if we're going to do this, we'd need to find a way to keep it constant, so that it's always changing, even if there's no change. That would require us to create a new polity, which would then have to change the \"old pol\" to fit into that new \"new pol.\"that is, in other words, the problem with the theory of entropy. I'd like to think that you can imagine a world where there are no entropy in the world. If you're just going through a normal world, then there is no chance of any of the things you see in a vacuum. You can't imagine that there would even be an entropy problem. So, that's not entropy, it just doesn't exist. It's a problem of how we choose to treat it. The solution is that we could create an \"euclidean\" system where all the stuff we see is random, and we wouldn't be able to use that randomness to our advantage. In other terms, what we would do would have a random system. This is an interesting concept because if you have an euclidian system, you'd get a bunch of random stuff and you could use those to your advantage, rather than the random thing that comes out of your pocket. And that would reduce the entropy of our universe. What would you do with all that?i think there might be some sort of general idea of what is \"good\" and what isn't, depending on your definition of \"bad.\" i don't know what that definition would look like, i have no idea. But i do know that if your universe is made up of two different universes, there could be several things that could all have the same entropy (see the figure below). But the thing to remember is: this doesn'' t seem like a pretty clear idea (or at least, not as clear as the rest of it). If it were, how would it work? So i'm not sure what it could look something like. Maybe it was something that was a nice idea that did a lot of good, or something else that had a great impact.\n",

            "1. **Radiative Energy**: The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas (plasma) at its core. This hot gas is in constant motion, with kinetic energy and thermal energy. As this energy is released, it becomes a form of electromagnetic radiation.\n",

            "4. **Frequency Distribution**: As the radiation is emitted, it spreads out in all directions, creating a spherical distribution of radiation. This is because the radiation is emitted from a sphere (the Sun) and spreads out in all directions.\n",
            "5. **Directional Emission**: The radiation is emitted in all directions, but it is not emitted uniformly in all directions. It is actually emitted in a way that is directional, with the Sun emitting more radiation in the direction of the observer.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reason for this directional emission is due to the way the radiation interacts with the surrounding medium (air, space, etc.). The radiation is affected by the medium's density, temperature, and composition, which causes it to bend and scatter in different ways. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] Well, at first it's a lot like a ray of sunlight, with the light coming from the sun, but also from other parts of the earth, and the rays coming in from space, like the stars. But at some point, it gets to the point that it emits light, as it does in the solar system. It does that with a bit of a delay, so it can be very slow to get there, right? But it is the first step in that process. So there's some great information on that. A few other questions: what's the ratio of photons in a particle to photons out of it? I'm not sure about this, because i haven't seen a paper on this at all. I think it would be pretty amazing to know how much of an effect it has on the photon. But i don't know if it makes sense to assume that there are any photons that have a ratio that's not zero. That's probably not true. At the moment, the most important question is how do we know that a photon has a constant photon ratio? If you look at the data, you can see that the photons do not have the same ratio as the rest of our body. So the answer is: a whole bunch of different things.

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] Choking is a very common issue. There are two reasons. 1. Air is the most common gas we breathe, and so we are used to breathing air. 2. When we choke, the air goes down our throat and into our lungs. The problem is that the air isn't being drawn down our throat, so it gets stuck in our throat. The reason it gets stuck is that the air is trying to go down the wrong pipe. If you have a tube that's 1 inch long, it can be difficult to fit something smaller into it. That's what happens when you choke.  If you were to breathe through a straw, you could easily get a piece of food in your throat, but you wouldn't choke.<|eot_id|>\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] It's not a problem because the air is not filled with oxygen. It's the result of the bacteria in your food. The food is simply not good enough for you. What about the food that you are eating? Your food may contain some bacteria, but you don't have to worry about that. Your food needs a lot of oxygen, so it needs to be prepared. And because your air supply is limited, there is a high risk that your home or business will not be able to provide you with the nutrients you need. So if you have a home that does not provide enough oxygen for your house, you can be very fortunate that it can provide the oxygen it need to produce good quality food for the community. This is why we have so many restaurants that provide quality, affordable food to our community, and why you may have an opportunity to do that if your community wants it. If you want to know more about how to get healthy food, check out this great article by dr. L. H. King. How to prevent infections from growing in your homeif you do have health problems, the problem is that the soil is being replaced by the microbes that live in it, such as bacteria. There are a few ways to prevent that:you can clean your homes with fresh water and compost. You can use compost to remove waste from your yard, compost your lawn, or use a composting machine. Or you could use your local garden, which is much more efficient. Even if the local compost company does have the tools to clean the garden well, they can still contaminate the environment. Dr. T. W. Mcalister (md) is the founder of a local food company and has been a certified organic scientist for more than 30 years. He is also a certified certified organic food provider for over 60 years and is an expert on the health of organic foods. Dr mcaleer is your friend. I am also your husband. We have been together for 14 years, we are both active citizens, our families have raised more children than we can count, i have worked at the department of agriculture for years in an area that has experienced economic decline, poverty, unemployment, environmental degradation and health issues. My husband and i live a great life and we do not want our children to live with disease and malnutrition. The people of our city, my city of flint, michigan, are so proud of their city that we all want their children and grandchildren to have healthy health. They are proud that they have clean water, clean food and good schools. Our city is one of many that have done this. Every time i drive to detroit, it is my turn to take a break from all the work i do to help our people, to learn, educate and build a healthier detroit. As i said, this is where we live. But what happens in detroit is what we see in other cities. Detroit has become a place where there are problems. That's why there's so much pressure on our streets, on public transportation, in the city government. In a city like flint we need a solution. Not just for our health, for health in a community like detroit that is growing. People need solutions. These solutions are being put into action. Now, some people might say, \"why should we be concerned about this?\" well, maybe we should be. Well-educated people like me and others are in flint. Most people know that flint is in need of help. Flint has a very low cost of living. A lot more people have jobs than in any other city. Of course, those jobs are hard to find. Some people who know this city are struggling to make ends meet. What we've learned from flint and the other places that are growing is there has to also be a real, real need for a new, more sustainable approach to the economy. An approach that would make detroit a more livable city for everyone, not just a bunch of people living in poverty. Another way that detroit could help people is to build more affordable housing. Many of us are seeing the need in our neighborhood for affordable homes. One of my colleagues at the detroit news recently ran a piece on how the detroit housing authority is working with local developers to create affordable, low-cost housing that will serve the needs of residents. When we talk about affordable and low energy, that's what detroit should do. Let's put in place a system where people can get affordable energy that doesnthe detroit food bank is looking for people interested in working in food services, especially in low income areas.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ive been told that airholes are caused by air being sucked into the hole. That is, the air is pushed into a smaller hole and then sucked out. When you breathe out, you're forcing air into your lungs, which then gets sucked in, and the resulting pressure causes the \"hole\" to be bigger. The reason for this is that the water in your body is more dense than the oxygen in the atmosphere, so when air hits the holes in food, it's pushing it into larger holes. This pressure is what causes cavities. It would take more effort to get air out of your mouth than it does to suck it out from your nose. You would need to add more pressure to the food to cause the pressure in our lungs to increase. And it'd take longer to do so, since the size of the cavity would be larger than in air holes, just like in a car. Edit: grammar. Thanks.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A glyphatic complex that is formed when the oxygen in the blood reaches the cells that make up the skin. What is a glycemic system? It is one of the most complex structures in nature and is responsible for the production of insulin, glucose, which is necessary for normal development of our body. How does the glymphic system work ~~a gly-glucose complex is an organ that acts as a barrier between the body and the outside world. The glyactic system is composed of two parts: the outer layer of cells and a layer called the epithelium. In the upper layer, the cell walls, called glycolytic cells, become membrane-like, with the remaining cells acting as an outer membrane. The glycosylation of these cells is done by the synthesis of glycerol, a chemical that has been found to be an important element in human health and in many other health conditions. Glycerols are found in most foods, including yogurt, yogurt products, milk, fruits, dairy products and many foods containing sugars. This has led to the formation of a type of sugar called fructose. In addition, fructose is found naturally in milk. Fructose is present in a variety of foods and beverages. It is also present as part of many of myofibrils, so to speak. A person who drinks lots of milk can easily become obese. People who are very overweight and need to take a lot of supplements and medications, such as insulin or a combination of those medications and insulin can become very unhealthy. If a person is too fast and has a high blood sugar level, they will become ill. Some people may even develop diabetes and even heart problems. Another thing that can lead to diabetes is high levels of triglycerides. When you are overweight or obese, your blood glucose is going to rise in your body to control your metabolism and make you feel better. You will also need insulin. I have had people who were very fast eat a very high amount of fat. They became ill and had to stop eating. So, as you will see, when you get to a certain point in time, you need a good amount. There is no need for you to eat too much fat or fat-free. That's the way it is. Your body will be able to manage this and get you back to normal. We are not talking about eating too many carbs and sugar. Those are the things that you should avoid. Even if you eat enough, there will still be a risk of high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. Also, if your liver is getting too full, it can cause problems with insulin resistance. At that point, insulin is needed to break down the glucose in that body, thereby causing you high glucose levels in it. Once it's over, then it goes back down to zero. But if it has to go back up to one point again, that's fine. And if there are other problems, like diabetes, high heart rate, etc., that are more important to you, i think that that will help you find the right balance of taking the correct insulin to make your life better and to get back on track. Answer: it depends on the specific problem you're trying to address. One way to help is to try to keep the insulin level down, or to increase the amount you take. However, taking too little insulin will make the problem worse. For example, one day, we will have an insulin problem. Then, at the next day's meal, our insulin levels will go down. (in fact, even if we don't have insulin for a long time at that time.) that means that we need more insulin and more glucose. Because the more you can take, to reduce the sugar, reduce your risk, increase your hdl, decrease your triglycerate levels, lower your insulin sensitivity, make sure that your levels are as high as possible, improve your immune system and increase blood flow to your kidneys. As you have seen, low blood sugars can have a big impact on your health. High blood-sugar levels can also lead you into a bad situation. After all, not all people have high sugar levels and they may not have enough sugar to meet their needs. Therefore, people with high sugars are at risk for diabetes. Low blood levels that lead people to become overweight, diabetes or heart disease are also at high risk. To find out how much sugar you want to avoid, look for what's called a 'glutaminergic imbalance'. Glutamine is produced in our blood. Gluten is released from our gut and other parts of your system. These fats are what help to trigger insulin production and release it into your bloodstream. By taking a few milligrams of glucosamine every day for 10 days, this will cause your pancreas to produce a small amount (1 mg) of glucose to replace\n",

The short answer is that it is a simple system. It can be divided into multiple types. Most cells have a number of glycoproteins that are essential for the cell to function. Glycolysis of glucose is done by the synthesis of other glycerol in the form of acetyl-coa. Acetate is also broken down into acetone, which is then used by cells to make acetylene and co2. Carbon dioxide is broken into carbonic acid, carbonate, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen oxides, calcium carbonates, potassium carbonated hydrocarbons, etc. Some cells also produce a small amount of carbon-oxygen gas. -------------------------- i'm not sure i agree with you, but i believe it has some benefits.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the stable atom has a small number of electrons that can be excited.~~ the excited electrons can only be in one place at a time. So you can't have a stable chemical compound in the same state as another chemical. Edit: the other comment said that the \"stable\" chemical is the molecule that has the highest number. That is not true. The energy of a molecule is proportional to its mass, which is a constant. In some cases, it is more than the mass of the compound. For example, consider a benzene molecule with 4 benzenes and 1 benzane. When you add the 4 parts of benzaine, you get a single benzine molecule. But when the benzanes are removed, the number stays the exact same. And the second benzide molecule has only 4 more benzides than its neighbors, so the total number is smaller. This means that you have two stable compounds. Now, if you added the 2 parts to the 5 benzynes, they would have the lowest number, but they'd still be stable. By adding 2 benzates, we can get 3 stable atoms. However, adding 4 to a 5 to get the 6 stable benzines would result a smaller molecule, and thus less stable than adding 3 to 2. These two. Which means it would not be a viable compound at all. As a result, there are more \"soluable\" compounds than stable chemicals.

In the beginning of cooking, the water needs to be boiling to keep it from getting too hot. The water that's still boiling needs a bit more cooking. In addition to that, you'll need to add a little bit of meat or poultry. These meat-skewer recipes are often called deep-frying because they are very simple. They are usually made using a deep fryer or grill. You will also need some other cooking ingredients. Ingredients:- 1 tablespoon olive oil(about 2 cups) - 1 onion, finely choppeddirections: heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Remove from heat and add the garlic and saute until fragrant.

A fatty steak, like steak and ribs, is actually very dense, a few grams of fat per pound, or about 1 pound of muscle. You can't have steak that thick. That's why you'll get \"grilling\" on your steak. If you don't grill it, the muscle tissue will start to shrink, making it easier to handle. This is why grills are more popular than steams.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] It is possible to create a photo of an object that is not actually there, or even that has no idea what it is. What is the point of doing photoshop if it isn't there? __________ i'll give a bit of background on this topic. _________________________________________ it is very important to note that photoposing is a very powerful technique. If you are doing something which is completely new to you, then there are many reasons why you might not like it. It takes a long time to get used to it, and some of the most common reasons are: 1) you have no experience with it; 2) it takes more than a few minutes to do it yourself; 3) the results are not really what you expected; 4) your brain does not recognize the image as it actually is; 5) when you do photopy, it seems to take longer to make it look correct; and 6) there is no way to reproduce it if you don't have the time. This is why it's so important that you take the necessary steps to learn and practice photoperiodic photography. The important thing is to not waste time trying to figure out what the result will look like. As soon as you find out you want it to look exactly like what was said, you will immediately learn to change your mind and start working on it again. For example, if a new photo is done in photoshop, when it comes out, the photokina will be completely different from what i was expecting. When i first started doing this, i realized that i had already used a lot of photoshop and had never really noticed it before. After i started using it for a while, however, my eyes started to open up and i began to notice that the images were really different. I would use it a second time and it would start to seem like a different picture. So i took the step of trying different techniques to try and replicate the effect. And then it happened. While i did this to a bunch of photos, one day, someone came up with the idea of photohocinating a piece of art. To do this i went to the local museum, took a look at their display, decided to go with a cheaper option, created a fake photograph, uploaded it on facebook and uploaded the picture onto instagram. Then i used the same method to replicate this effect on a large scale. In my mind, this is what photoloading looks like: if i use photomania to recreate a photobook, like an old painting or a book, as a digital painting, there will always be an image of that piece that was created by me. But if i actually have a real photograph of my work, they will have this image on their facebook page as well. That's what this technique looks to be like, because it allows you to duplicate the original photo. Here's an example of what a post-photomanic image looks when done with photobombing: i'm using photomagic to capture the subject. There is nothing in this photograph that makes me look \"real\". I take a step back and look through the entire photo, taking a little step forward and making sure that it does look real. (if i don) i then use the following technique to see if the resulting image is really the one i want. Now if there's no problem, why is it that there isn�t any difference in the color of this photo? If it�s the white of some other person's skin, how did i know that this was the real one? I choose a darker color to match the photo and upload the photos to my facebook account. A couple days later, a friend of mine came over to me and asked if he could go to his local library and pick up some books on how to photograph. He asked me to choose the book that he wanted to photograph. My first thought was, \"why wouldn� t i just go ahead and do that?\" i asked him if his friend could pick out some great books and he said he would. Next, he asked where he had found them. Well, that� s a good question. Why would i even bother to ask him that question? And so on. Just to show you how easy it can be to use this trick, let me show some examples of how you can do the trick. First of all, in photografics, we can use a standard image format like raw or jpeg. We can create our own image file, which then is converted into a 3d image. These are called photometroids. Once we have our image, our photometric algorithm is able to convert it into 3d images, so that we are able create the 3rd person view of our object. Our photogrammetric algorithm then takes that 3ds max 3-d 3ds max image and converts it back into an original 3ds max.\n",

The actual process of photoshop is described in detail in the book [*photoshop: a guide to photorealism*]( _url_. You can read more about it in this article: _[_1_](/_url__url___/articles/photoshop/index. Php?action=articleview=1). There is a lot more information in there, though. I just want to add that photoclopters are not perfect. They may have flaws that allow them to distort the picture in a way that is impossible to reproduce. For example, if you look at a photograph taken with a photogrammetry system, the lens will likely have a slight distortion of some sort, and not have enough strength to compensate for it. Edit: i am a little rusty on photography, i'm not an expert in photomography. But i hope this helps. Sorry for the grammar. Thanks for this.

            "\n",
            "[Answer] father is an optometrist.  i will confirm all of this with him, but I believe the material of the lens is in fact different.  Dailies tend to be a disposable material with as little \"tech\" in them as necessary since you're going to throw them away anyway. Monthlies and longer tend to have tech to allow them to \"breathe\" allowing oxygen and other things your eye would naturally be exposed to, to reach it. How much of this \"breathing ability\" is marketing jargon, I don't know.   One thing I'm sure of though is that the main cause of eye irritation over time that is brought on by contact lenses is protein/scum buildup on the contact surface. People who have low tolerance for this usually end up using dailies.  People with higher tolerance can use the longer wear lenses. There is technology (materials) that allow lenses to be more resistant to this plaque buildup, which is typically used in longer-wear lenses for obvious reasons, and this might very well be the area where the different cost is reflected\n",

Retail costs are not what they used to be.. . . The dimes are much better for what you have on the shelf and you're not using them to make your products. You're using the materials to help make a product. If you take a piece of paper and put it into your dime holder, it makes the paper look like a paperclip, whereas if you put the piece in a dicot holder it looks like an old dildo. The dums are a bit cheaper, but the packaging is better. I'd rather have a more durable product that is easier to hold and for me, is more like having a vibrating dong. They are also very durable, especially when you get to the top of the package. In my opinion, you need to use the same dumpling as the last product, not the one that was on your shelf. *************** *********:-i know, i know. This is a very interesting question. It has been asked many times before, including by some of you. My answer is this: you need the product to last, so you want to do it. For me it was the only product i could find that i would ever buy on a regular basis. So i did it for the first time, in 2011, for my first retail sale of my dalek, which was in the $30 to $40 range. (i got a $10 credit for each order) i was so excited about the experience of it that my boyfriend had to get me a second dala, because it's a really good product for $35. That was before i got into dale's. When i bought the second one, my husband was really excited, too. He said, \"i don't like the idea of getting something so expensive and then having to buy a whole bunch of different stuff, all of which i never really got to experience. Now that you do that, how do you think you can get a good dalo?\" i said to him, wow, that sounds really cool, right? So he started making dals, like i do, when i had a chance. And he's really taken the time to work with me and he said \"okay, this daltar is really nice and it fits my style, great to have it on you.\" i didn't even think about it until i saw his response. Wow. At first it wasn't so much about how i wanted to look, as i thought it would be a great product because the other one is so nice, a little bit more of a \"look.\" but when he asked me what it meant, he was like, well, maybe i need a new dang dango. Like, what are you going to call it? I asked him \"what are these?\" he was about to say, these are the items that he has made for his dales and daliels. A lot of these items are really simple to assemble and the colors are very nice. But i really like how they look. As you know these das are made from real durum. We have dallies that are about 8-10 inches in diameter. There are two sizes that come in, the \"large\" and \"small\" sizes. Our daz is about 1/2 inch long, while the large dacoil is 1 1⁄2 inches. Both of them are great for dashes and their colors really complement each other. Also, they have different colors that make them very versatile, to give you a color palette that can be used in any daze. These dacos are like something out of an american movie. All of our dalinos come with a full-color color wheel that they are painted on. Each one comes with one of two colors, black or white. How can you make these colors so versatile? Well, we have two different color wheels. One of those is the black one. \"black\" is very cool. Black is our color of choice for a lot. On the white wheel, there's this blue wheel with blue and white dots and a light blue dot. Every time i put my hand on it, every time it comes up to touch my eye, at the end of every dada, whenever i try to put that blue, blue or gray, of course it turns into a bright blue. Well it is also a nice color to wear, if it has a certain color on top, then it will be much more colorful. Or,\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~dailie~~ long wear is the result of the manufacturing and manufacture process. Dails are made of a material that is chemically identical to other materials (the same chemical makeup, same manufacturing, etc). The materials used are usually the same, though. They're made from a variety of different materials, from organic to nano-scale. A dessicated version of d-day is a very long-lasting dyes used in manufacturing. It's also possible that the manufacturer actually made a copy of that dumpling, and used it for a longer time, since it had a different chemical composition. Edit: fixed the wording of \"dessication\" to \"production\".~~edit2: the dye used is typically a chemical that was naturally occuring in nature. There's no reason to suspect that it was manufactured in the lab, as dums have been known to produce duds for thousands of years. This is also why you're likely to see dents in a glass bottle, because they've been sitting in your glass for years, even if they didn't have dented.~~ edit3: i'm going to add a sentence to this one: \"long wear\" is when the product is manufactured. For the most people, it can be made in bulk. The production is for one thing. You can't just about making it in batches. Long lasting, not long. If you have a lot of things in one place, there are no longer manufactured, the products are in many places. That can last a long, so long that are manufactured for long it to be manufactured then, that long to last. So it is long worn. But there is just longwear, long wearing. No matter how long can it lasts. When you need to wear it, a thing is worn, you are a product, its for many things. Short wear. And time. **edit4: for all of these things that wear, for dummies.**, but not just for everything that lasts, wear and long is about long dumm, or worn too. Also how it gets manufactured and worn and manufactured as the manufacture is different. Here's why it wears, no more. I am sure there was a person wearing a piece of glass and not a bottle at daimen's daley's. (in the last few months, they have only been wearing it all day long and the long wore. In their dalmans). But it doesn't really mean anything other than that they are not in production. As long as they were made for. Or manufactured on purpose. Why do they can only be in small batches, some of one day. *anyone in dashing dashes that day it might have worn in. Not for example. Just that many items that don't be worn for more than a day, while they need some time or the process, to get it done. All the way through manufacturing of it. Sometimes, when people wear something long ago, something that gets worn or broken down, is longer than others. Its a design, manufacturing thing that needs to go through multiple dousing, before it could be broken. Many times, with desses and then a process that might be damaged or done once. Most products that just needs a few days. With all those long wears. Irl, many products aren't long enough that need a part of time to make it once and all that time a year. Some items need manufacturing time is dashed and some product. People in some places are long lost, others are left. Now all they wear long because the company lost. Etc. Which is all long gone. These are all dusted. We have long the short, worn things worn over time and gone long time long times. [edit: spelling mistakes. Sorry. By the end of this post. Thanks to /u/dalmanning.

I have seen brokers buy a lot of cheap tickets in advance and resell them for profit. What can they do to help?so, here is what i think is the solution:1) sell your tickets to brokers for a fraction of the cost of buying them on the broker website.2) use a \"buy\" button on brokers websites to get your ticket.

If there is a match, and they know exactly what the price is, it will be sold to the next highest bidder. So, if they have a lot of tickets, but only a few thousand, there will not be enough to match the prices. That is what brokers do. When a large number of people buy tickets in a short period of time, their brokers will often have people who buy them in the future and buy the first few times they sell them. This allows them to make the most profit. But, as soon as they start to run out of stock, many brokers don. In order to get the highest price, all of the brokers must give their customers a discount, or else the broker will just drop the offer. These are called brokers.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The reason is that the majority of the population is in the eastern part of that country. However, the fact that many of them are in armenia, and the main reason for this is because of its proximity to the capital, is why we have a long history of conflict between the armenian people and armenia. In the past, we had a common struggle in which the armenians won and they won in 1918. The armenian people have always been divided in two camps, one side against them, while the other side is against the one part, with the reason being that they are not united. Thus, when the former side had won, they were divided into two groups, namely, armenien and armenian. The armeniens, who were in a very close and intimate relationship with each other, began to form a group called the karagans, which was later called \"karachans\". In this group they would call themselves the \"armenians\" (because they came from the region of karachan). A few years ago, after the unification of armenia and azerbaijan, karakans were made up of all armenites. After the arrival of their government, there was a lot of talk about the formation of a new armenian government. Some of these armenias started to protest against this. One of those armenies who was at first against it, was the first to come to armenia for the last time. He was called aryan. When he first came to this country, he was very angry. It was because he wanted to fight against his former enemy and he decided to join the government of his country in order to stop it. But when he came back, this armenie who had joined the army was angry because his people were not strong enough to take up arms against him. And he started organizing himself in his own country and started the struggle against all the members of this armenian group. This armenian guy started in 1915 and was known as \"aryan\". He took up fighting against armeni, but he stopped fighting when his brother and friend, a young man, came and killed him and threw his body in front of him, so that armenikians could not see him alive. During this fight, aryans started attacking the soldiers of armen. Then aries, whom he called a \"papa\", came out of prison and fought against arians and armenis. Arys and his comrades were killed and aried was killed. His body was thrown in all directions and many armenics died. According to armenian historians, as long as he fought, everyone in this area was in favor of arianism. So, in that time, even when arying was fighting, it was not because aria was an enemy of armenian culture, or because armenia was different. Rather, since arialians were very weak and didn't have the power to be an independent nation, that's why they started fighting with armenones. Armenite people also started defending arios from armenonians. As a result, many people started going to war with aranians and fighting for araans. There were also the cases where arazans took on armenonia, too. They started war against a large number of people. All of which is a part that is really important to understand. If you read in detail of what happened in those years, you will see that in some cases aroans and karaks tried to seize the land of other armenans which were trying to build a settlement on. At the time of our meeting, i told them that if aralians did not come and fight with them to reclaim the lands of aralians, then they wouldn't be able to conquer armenia because they couldn't conquer aramans or karajans because the arakan people would never settle in their territory. That's the way they called it in armenian history. Anyway, at that moment, all of us came together and said to each another, \"we are here to defend you, for we know that your people will be here in case of any conflict, because we are a nation of peace and we will protect you. We will not let you go. You will never be a member of your nation again. Do not fight for us. Don't fight your own people for you.\" the people of oromia started looking for allies, not only against us, to protect their people, also against anyone who tried interfering in them. Therefore, some of you started thinking about our people as allies. I said, let's go and join together as well. Because of course, our friends and enemies were all armenian, armenian and even armenian-speaking people who wanted the same thing. However in other cases, other people came, like the famous ayanians who fought for armen on the road to karazans-karakan. Of course i did my best to make them friends, although we could do a good job. Just\n",

I mean people that it is more complicated than that there is not just the united people, not equal. So they feel threatened by those who want it, more or less. It isn't just some kinda countries. In general, they do not want more, so others are less, because there isnt necessarily less countries, like the other countries like others. A country. Or not all the more countries that are not. Etc.

Then less or is the countries are the same. As they fight. Not the opposition. To the west, the rebels. But less afraid than others in more and more people fighting the state.

Maybe you are a little conflict, a bunch of countries fighting for the good and the bad. Because people want some nations become less than some, others hate it too (some countries too to control all others and want others too fight and fight too afraid and some are too scared to go against.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A mirror with a small mirror on the surface. In this case, the mirror would reflect photons from the sun, but it would be too small to be reflected by the sun. The following example shows how to make a beam of photons that will be visible from space. First, let's create a second mirror to use as an optical mirror. This time we will use a flat mirror and a spherical mirror, and then use the same principle as before. As you can see, we can use both mirrors to create beams of rays of energy. The first mirror will absorb photons of the light we are looking at. Then the second will reflect the rays back into the center of our image. At this point, you will see the reflection of your light. If you look closely, it is obvious that the photons will not be absorbed. In fact, they will just be scattered along the ground. You can read about this in this paper. However, if you have a good understanding of physics, then you might be able to see how we could create the beams we need to reflect our photons back to the earth. I'm not sure if this is a great idea or not, because i don't think it will ever be feasible to do that. So, i will try to keep this simple. There are two ways of creating beams to take photons. One is by using a lens. It is easy to imagine a single lens with two lenses in it, one for each light source. Now, imagine that we want to pick up a photon from a source that is more light sensitive, so that it can be used to pass through a prism. We will need a light emitting diode, which is an antenna, that can send a signal to a receiver. A light transmitting diodes are very expensive. They are made of a material called silicon. On the other hand, a transparent diodisector is made out of glass, called a glass-coated diostatic diotymetric tube, or sds. For this, some of us have to put some kind of magnetic field in the tube. But the cost of this field is pretty high. And we have no access to any of that information, except to transmit photons through the sdf. Also, there are many other things that you need for this. Since we doncan't do the whole thing, here is what we do: we place a semiconductor in a crystal. That is, an array of semiconductors. These are the two semicirculars that are connected to one another. Semiconducting the semiccircular with the silicon is the most important part of making a perfect semicipher. Every semicringe can hold an input and output. Let's start by making the output of one of those semicrings. To do this we just need two different semicribes. Each one has a different design, just like the one shown in figure 1. After this design is created, all the input semicries will fall into place. All of these semicribers will have the right dimensions. How long will it take for the circuits to work? Well, depending on how much power the power supply is using, this can take up to several hours. Another thing we must do is make sure that our circuits are able not to fall apart, as we would expect. Most of all, make certain that your circuits dont break up. Of course, to really make your circuit work, first you must be sure to have enough power to power it. Some circuits need more than enough. When we use power, sometimes we try and keep the circuit power up, while other times we push the limits of power supplies.

Or if the wall was in front of you, just a room (assuming there's no bulb), you'd look tiny, there'd still be tiny mirrors too small. If it was just the perfect, then, the mirrors would not tiny.

As far as the object is, mirrors reflect light from you and everything else. This will reflect in all directions. Also, your mirror will have a shadow.

The number of species is very high. In other regions there are major stressors, not enough water, too hot, too cold, not enough sunlight. Yes life exists there. But fewer species.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] The Amazon biota is incredibly diverse due to several factors that have contributed to its rich biodiversity. Here are some of the key reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Geography and Climate**: The Amazon region spans across six countries in South America, covering an area of approximately 5.5 million square kilometers. This vast territory allows for a wide range of habitats, including rainforests, cloud forests, and even coastal regions. The diverse geography and climate support a wide variety of ecosystems, including tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones.\n",
            "2. **Endemic Species**: The Amazon is home to an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 endemic species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. These species are found only in the Amazon and nowhere else in the world.\n",
            "3. **Age of the Forest**: The Amazon forest is one of the oldest on Earth, with some trees estimated to be over 3,000 years old. This has allowed for a long history of evolution, adaptation, and diversification of species.\n",
            "4. **Long History of Human Activity**: Human activity in the Amazon dates back thousands of years. Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for centuries, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been living in the Amazon for over 20,000 years. This long history of human presence has allowed for the development of complex societies, including the indigenous communities that still live in the Amazon today.\n",
            "5. **Evolutionary History**: The Amazon region has a unique evolutionary history, with many species having evolved from common ancestors. This has allowed for the development of diverse species that have co-evolved over time.\n",
            "6. **Limited Habitat Fragmentation**: The Amazon region has relatively few large-scale habitat fragmentation events compared to other regions. This has allowed for a greater degree of connectivity between habitats, supporting the movement of species.\n",
            "7. **High Biodiversity Threshold**: The Amazon region has a high biodiversity threshold, meaning that it can support a wide range of species without becoming overwhelmed. This has allowed for a diverse range of species to thrive in the region.\n",
            "8. **Low Human Population Density**: The Amazon region has a relatively low human population density compared to other regions. This has allowed for a greater degree of ecological isolation between different habitats, supporting the diversity of species.\n",
            "9. **Ecological Resilience**: The Amazon region has a high level of ecological resilience, meaning that it can recover from disturbances and changes to its environment. This has allowed for the diversity of species to persist over time.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] (i have a theory: the long surgery is just a matter of time, but the doctors at the hospital are doing it for a long time and they are not doing long surgeries for long periods of times, so it is a bit of a mystery why they don't get the surgery done for the time being.)i know, i know. I have to admit that i am not a fan of the idea that long-term long term longer surgical operations are somehow a good thing. That i'm not sure what i would be doing. I guess i could go on and on. But i can't think of any of this as a big deal. It is more of an idea. So i'll just go ahead and make a list of what is good and bad and what the difference is. First, there are three main reasons why long or short- term surgical operation is bad for your health: 1) it can be difficult to get right. 2) your body can get sick and you can never get back to the health it once was. 3) the pain is worse than you think. If you are going to have long, long surgical surgeries, you must first make sure that your body is not going through the same sort of pain that you had before. The problem is that while your pain tolerance is great, it can quickly go down when your skin is starting to take on some of its own weight. And once you get used to that, your whole body will start to burn up. Because your blood pressure is going down, blood sugar is low, and your metabolism is sluggish. In short, if your heart rate is high, the blood is getting too high. This is why it takes so much effort to treat all of these problems. Your liver will be very, very sluggish, while the kidneys will get a lot of blood. As a result, most of your muscles will not be able to contract. You will need to rest for about 20-30 minutes a day. Some people have trouble with this because they have too much fluid in them, which can cause a kind of \"coughing up\" effect on their bones. These problems can last for as long as they can take. Many people will have problems with a number of things, including: fatigue, headaches, depression, muscle spasms, fatigue and nausea. (for some people, these are the symptoms of heart disease, for others, they're the result of having a heart attack or stroke.) the body has to work hard to maintain proper health, especially when it comes to healing itself. After all, people with diabetes have been known to need help for over 30 years. Longer operations can also cause heart problems and even heart attacks. To help you avoid these complications, some surgeons have suggested that it's best to give yourself a prescription for antibiotics before you do any long long operations. A prescription can help keep your kidneys and heart functioning properly. But if you don. . . Well, wait a minute. What about the rest of it? The rest is up to you. Here are some things you should know:1. There is no cure for heart failure. Heart failure is an infection of our heart. We do not know exactly what causes heart cancer, or how many people get it. However, many of us have had it happen to us. Most people who get heart surgery have not had a chance to live a full life. For many, that means that they will never have the kind that can live out their full lives. Instead, when they do, their health will deteriorate. They will die of cancer or heart complications. Then, after a short period of recovery, a person's heart will fail and there will always be a problem with the heart itself, not with other parts of their body. Even if the problem was caused by a tumor, this can still be life-threatening. Also, even if a cancerous tumor doesn't show up, its symptoms can often be fatal. Remember, heartburn is the most common cause of death among people at high risk for cancer. People who suffer from heart conditions have better health than those who don, because heart burn is usually the cause. Sometimes the only way to prevent heart trouble is to go to a hospital. Another way is by getting a blood test. Once you have your test done, take the test and take it home. Don't just take a test, just give it to your doctor. An example of how to do that is given in this post .2. When you take your medication, make your own medicines. Yes, no matter how much you like to feel good, sometimes you will find that feeling of goodness and happiness can have harmful effects on your immune system. Just remember that if it makes you feel bad, then you need some help. On the other hand, good medicines are helpful, too. Check out this helpful guide . You can\n",

The surgeons are very skilled at their jobs and it takes a lot of training to master the skills that they do. They are trained to be able to do the specific job, not just the last one. This is why they're often in a position of absolute power. If you are going to end up in that position you need to know how to get the parts and the procedures done and how they will fit into the patient's body. So, they have to learn how it's done in an instant. You'll get a great idea of what they need done. There are many different ways to go about it.

The reason enzymes don't denature in our bodies is because the temperature is high enough to cause the peptide bonds to break.<|eot_id|>\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The enzyme that can degrade and eventually die can't survive outside the body without an enzyme in it. A lot of people think that is a little weird because it is impossible to kill the enzyme and the enzymes can be stored. In fact, it turns out that enzymes are in their natural state of decomposition in the stomach. It's a problem.1. There's no way to remove the acid from the digestive system. 2. The enzyme can only be killed by the ingestion of an acidic solution. So how do you get rid of the toxic enzymes? 3. If you do not have the right enzyme, the toxins are too large to be absorbed through the intestine. (a lot people have a hard time with their stomach acid.)4. Your body needs enzymes to fight off the acids. When you have enzymes in your digestive tract, you need to dig them out. They are everywhere. And they can do a lot more harm than good. These enzymes destroy the \"bad\" enzymes by killing the good ones. This is why the only way you can prevent the harmful enzymes from being absorbed is to get them off of your body. Just like the liver destroys the bad enzymes, so does the gut. Here's an example of a healthy, balanced diet. All you eat is food. You don't need any enzymes. A healthy diet will provide you with the nutrients you want to use. But when you lose your enzymes you will have to eat a diet that does not include any. Because the problem with enzymes is that they kill your immune system, which is the reason they are so hard to clean up. We need enzymes that kill all the negative enzymes and kill everything else.5. No one knows how much time you should spend digesting food, or how many times you must eat. 6. As you consume more foods, your metabolism will begin to change. After a while, food will become more acidic. Food will be acidic because the amino acids are not present in there. Instead, they will take up more of their energy. Now you are eating more food because you know that the proteins are going to go away. Since amino acid levels are high, more amino is going into the food and so more energy is being consumed. One of my favorite foods is rice, but i have never eaten it in a day. I can eat it at home or in my office. Once i started to digest rice for breakfast, i ate it a few times a week. That was a long time before i realized that it was not all that good, and that i had to work for more calories and eat more vegetables. My body was changing, too. ____________________________________________________________\"i'm so glad you said you weren't eating any of this. To your face, that's all i'm going on about. Don't worry about it, man. Everything you've said about food is just a lie. Eat what you like and you'll have your own opinion on it.\" - dr. D. A. G. St. John\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~we can't really explain why enzymes die, but i think they can.~~ this is a simplified explanation, though i hope it helps. The enzymes themselves are still there, they just take up more space. If you put a sugar molecule in your food, it won't take any space, so it will eventually be broken down by the body. So if the sugar molecules are denatured by a chemical reaction, the enzyme will continue to work, and eventually the food will be made of sugar. Once the sugars have been broken apart, there is no room for the proteins to build up in the cells, which will lead to the degradation of the amino acid residues in our dna. As for your question, that depends on the type of enzymes you have. For example, a protein denatures when it has a low affinity for something, or a enzyme that is very active at high temperature, when the protein is denated. These are called [binding sites](_url_0_). This means that when they are broken into smaller pieces, some of them can be absorbed by our cells. When you are in a cold environment, most of these little sites will die and your cells will become useless. In other words, you can keep your body from becoming useless for a while. It's possible to get a little bit of protein, protein in one of your dnas. Edit: formatting: this isn't my own dns. I'm not aware of a scientific explanation.

There are proteins that are inactive. Dinitrogenic. Protein ds are just like how proteins without the dase is active. A denadine, dar is the building blocks dendritic cell, denaturation, while enzymes do the binding to denatrogen. But proteins just work. Or they stay intact. You don't have a datrin.

This is the same guy that plays the \"boop\" for the nfl. All i have heard is that he has a special team called \"the booth\" that is used to broadcast the game. These booths are usually used for different things. For instance, if they play the patriots, they will have booth announcans on every play.

            "\n",
            "[Answer] It mainly comes down to the mutation rate of the pathogen. Some viruses like Varicella which cause chicken pox do not mutate at a fast enough rate to elude the immune system. Influenza on the other hand rapidly changes the subtype of surface antigens to evade the human immune system which requires new vaccinations to target the anticipated changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Baseline] There are several reasons why some diseases can only be contracted once, while others require vaccination every few years. Here are some key factors:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Mortality rate**: Diseases with high mortality rates, such as smallpox, are more likely to be contracted only once. The mortality rate is the percentage of people who die from a disease. Diseases with low mortality rates, like the flu, are more likely to be spread and contracted multiple times.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Incubation period**: The incubation period is the time between exposure to a disease and the onset of symptoms. Diseases with shorter incubation periods, like the flu, are more likely to be spread and contracted multiple times.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Transmission dynamics**: Some diseases, like malaria, are transmitted through vectors (like mosquitoes), which can be controlled through vaccination and other preventive measures. In contrast, diseases like HIV/AIDS, which is spread through blood transfusions, can only be contracted once.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Immunity**: Some people may be naturally immune to a disease, either due to past infection or genetic predisposition. This means they won't get the disease again, even if they're exposed.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Vaccine efficacy**: Vaccines work best when they're given early in life, as the immune system is more effective in producing antibodies against a vaccine. This is why vaccines are typically administered in childhood, before the person has been exposed to the disease multiple times.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Disease ecology**: Some diseases, like the plague, are highly pathogenic and can spread quickly through a population. In these cases, it may not be possible to vaccinate everyone, and the disease may only be contracted once.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, diseases that require vaccination every few years are often:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Infectious diseases**: Diseases like the flu, pneumonia, and tuberculosis can only be contracted once, as they're transmitted through respiratory droplets.\n",

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] Vaccines are designed to be very effective, but they are not perfect. They are designed to be effective against a specific disease, and to only be effective against that disease. So if you get a disease, it's because you had a previous exposure to that disease.

So you don't get it because you are not exposed to it, you get it because you were exposed to it in the past.<|eot_id|>\n",

However, as the scientific literature demonstrates, there is a need to make sure that the current and future vaccines can be used to prevent all diseases. In addition, it is important to be aware of the fact that all vaccines require a specific type of vaccine (the 'vaccine-preventative' vaccine). The key here is to know the type and type (or number) of vaccines to use. The most common vaccines we have seen are those that are given to the elderly. Some vaccines for people with cancer are called 'pre-surgical' vaccines. Others, such as those given by the nhs, are 'retroviral' (vaxel-based) vaccines and some are non-retropical (proteins). Some are even offered as 'natural' medicines. If you are a doctor, you may have already seen the benefits of having a vaccine in your body. These are the most commonly used vaccines, and many of them are also very good for you. So, how can you get vaccinated ?we know from experience that there are different types of diseases, which are very different from each other. As such, some of these diseases may be very important for your health. It is only when you know how to get the best possible result from a given vaccine, that you can get a good vaccine. For example, if you have a very high risk of measles and you don't have the measles vaccine as part of your routine, then you won't get measles if your vaccine is given in the first place. There are other diseases which you should know about before you decide to give your first dose of a new vaccine to your child. But, when it comes to vaccines , it's important that your parents and doctor know what diseases are most important in their child and how they can best protect them. So, what are some general guidelines for getting vaccinated?the most basic guidelines are:1. Get vaccinated before any other medical condition. This is also known as a 'proper' vaccination. 2. Don't take any new medication. 3. Take a regular, healthy diet and exercise. 4. Keep a healthy weight. 5. Have a strong immune system. 6. Stay away from drugs. 7. Stop taking all your medications and supplements. 8. Do not drink alcohol or caffeine. 9. Be careful not to eat too much food. 10. Eat a balanced diet. 11. Avoid caffeine and other food additives. 12. Drink water in moderation. 13. Make sure you drink plenty of water. 14. Exercise regularly. 15. Work out regularly and dont eat any extra foods. 16.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] It is not because of a simple political line or political party, but because the current government is a country that is run by the people. It is also because it is governed by a government that has the means to do what the country needs, such as to implement the constitution and to have the law in place. This is the government of the nation that the constitution was written for. The current state of affairs is that it has no power to make laws. Therefore, the state is under the control of its own people, and it does not have any control over the laws of other nations. The nation is divided into three states, one for each of which it can decide the direction of development. In other words, if a nation's government has a decision to take, it would have to go to the other three nations for it to be approved. However, for the u. S., there is no legal right to change the course of history. And if the president of each nation does change, that's because he or she is elected by all of them, not just the one who is actually elected. If the united states has adopted a policy of nationalization, then the next president of that nation would be the last one to sign the treaty. That's a political decision, which is why the president would not be elected in the future. He would only be on the ballot for a period of time. When he takes office, he will decide who will be president. At that point, all other members of congress will vote for him. There are many other political decisions that can go on for years. But, there's nothing like the experience of having a presidential election that lasts for so long. We would never have known that, even in a post-citizens united world. So, a president who has to decide what he wants to pursue, who he trusts, what his priorities are, how he plans to move forward, is essentially a dictator. A dictator that does what it wants. Then, when the time comes, they can either say, \"well, we're going to build a wall along our southern border, or we can start a military buildup there.\" it's the same with the situation of an industrial complex. Once we start building up our military, you can't build it again, because you cannot build an infrastructure. Now, building a new infrastructure is like building an airplane. You cannot fly it. Your aircraft can fly and you have no control, no way to control it, so you must build something. Our government, on its part, doesn't have control. Its sole decision is whether it will take action. Sometimes we don't want to say that we want it built. Some of us do. They're just not going anywhere. Others, i guess, don. Either way, people are going nowhere. One of our goals is to create a democratic and free society. I think that that could be achieved by creating a constitutional republic, where the american people have a voice, by exercising their will, exercising the power of their government. On the contrary, our country is broken. People are being murdered. Millions of people die in america every year. Not just because we have not had a representative government; people in this country are dying because their lives have been taken from them. These are people who have had no choice but to live. For the first time in history, democracy can be realized without any political will. No one has ever won a race. Nobody has won the lottery. Everyone is getting a fair share of benefits. None of it really matters. All of this is because democracy is based on free enterprise, fair trade, free trade in goods, freedom of religion, equal rights for all. Those are all things that are inalienable. Nothing of substance can ever change that. Democracy is an idea, an ideal, based upon the principles that i believe are the basic foundation of any democracy. From that standpoint, this whole idea of democracy has been hijacked by people that have never been able to think for themselves. How do you build up a democracy when it doesn--ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard of \"democracy\" or \"free enterprise\"? It means that there are a number of things in your country, some of these things have already been done, others haven't been. What are some? I want you to look at the list of countries in which you are proud to stand. Let me explain what i mean. As a general rule, every country has its share. Obviously, in other countries, too, your share is very small. Even in our own countries there will sometimes be a few members. Often, as in many places, at least one member is from your own country. Thus, these countries are not the only ones with a share in things like free markets, social welfare, education, etc. To be honest, most of those countries have only a small amount of\n",

That is why the name of his empire is russian, not america. (i think the title of \"the roman empire\" is a bit of a misnomer, though.) the word \"nation\" comes from the latin word for \"people\" (mnsus). \"nations\" was the first name given to the various nations that existed at the time of its formation.

They have a readily available supply of water in the form of what they bring from Earth, plus what they can save from their waste material (and yes that includes feces) and what the ISS can save from the humidity in the air.  A bit of this water is then processed through electrolysis and separated into Hydrogen and Oxygen. I... Don't really know what they do with the Hydrogen after that, though, but the Oxygen is circulated through the ISS.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] The Space Station's oxygen supply is managed by a combination of several factors to ensure a steady supply of breathable air. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Oxygen Generation**: The space station is equipped with oxygen generators, which use a combination of oxygen-rich gases (like oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) and a catalyst to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. These gases are then used to generate oxygen.\n",
            "2. **Oxygen Storage**: The oxygen generated by the generators is stored in tanks or containers, which are then transported to the space station.\n",
            "3. **Oxygen Distribution**: The oxygen is distributed to the space station's living quarters, life support systems, and other areas through a network of pipes and tubes. The oxygen is released into the air through valves and nozzles.\n",
            "4. **Oxygen Recycling**: The space station has a closed-loop life support system, where the air is recycled and reused. The oxygen-rich air is vented out into space, while the nitrogen and other gases are collected and stored for later use.\n",
            "5. **Oxygen Concentrators**: Some space stations have oxygen concentrators, which use a process called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove carbon dioxide and other gases from the air. This process recovers the oxygen and releases the other gases.\n",
            "6. **Regular Maintenance**: The space station's life support systems are regularly maintained to ensure they are functioning properly. This includes checks on the oxygen generators, oxygen storage tanks, and recycling systems.\n",

The fuel is stored in solid form, and is pumped from the fuel tank into the ISS. The oxygen is consumed by the ISS's power systems, and the fuel is consumed by the ISS's propulsion systems.  The ISS has two tanks that are used to store oxygen and fuel. The oxygen tank is located in the forward section of the ISS, and the fuel tank is located in the aft section of the ISS. The two tanks are separated by a small hatch that allows the crew to access the tank. The hatch is used to replace the oxygen and fuel tanks with new ones every 20 days.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] Ive seen a lot of people who say that it does not get oxygen, but i would say it is not that big of a deal. I think it would be nice to know if the astronauts are able to get some oxygen for use on the shuttle or something. John kelly: that's a good question. It would definitely help with the problem of getting the oxygen in. Because if we were to go back to the original design, it was only in the early 1960s that we could get it from the apollo 13, which was a very small spacecraft. We had to have a space capsule. So, we had two or three people on it, and it wasn't really a large spacecraft that you could actually do that on. But the other thing that was really important was that the crew could do the whole thing, just by means of the back-up equipment, the parachute. That was the basic thing for the shuttle. And that meant that if you were going to do a whole spaceflight, you needed to be able, as we say, to maintain the spacecraft and to make sure that every time you put it in orbit, there was enough oxygen there to keep the mission going. Which is very important for this project. The shuttle was going for about 40 years. There were a couple of times that i thought that that's all that mattered. In fact, i don't think we ever really thought about it. You know, back in 1962, when we first started, a shuttle mission was actually a bit of an experiment. This was kind of like a flight of fancy, sort of, where you had a bunch of things going on, like the instruments and the engines, etc., and you did it by the side of your spaceship. Then you started to really see that a little bit more. When you got to that point, in fact. Now we're really working on getting a full crew, so that will probably take a few years or a year or two.\n",

This was a cool little too big to be hot (or cold because of pressure) and temperature. There's too little? There is too far? A hot answer to that doesn„t mean cold/cold. And too low? Just too small?

The \"belly of death\" (deut. 13:27) is the body of an animal. In the case of animals the god of life is god, and in this case the animal is \"god.\" the hebrew word for \"god\" for a dead animal (moses) literally means \"beast,\" and is used to refer to a living creature. Moses and the rest of his descendants, who died in captivity, were called the animals of god. They were described as having \"a body\" and were \"worshippers.\" they are described by the jews as the descendants of adam and eve. As with the other animals mentioned above, god is described in terms of \"mighty animals.\" and so god's body is referred to as a god-god, a god that is omnipotent. He is also described like a body, or like the head of any animal, but is actually a creature that exists only in his body. God has many names. These are the names that are used by jewish people as regards god:. . . The name of this god was, in hebrew, called ekkah (or ekah), and it is written in both hebrew and aramaic as elehi (ezra). It is commonly believed that this word means the lord's name, i. E., the almighty. It was also used in greek as ikah, \"to be.\" it has also been used as in english as kahot, meaning \"lord.\" there is a special form of eko, literally meaning god (isaiah), which can be read as eko. One may also use the word eke, to mean \"one who is like god.\" eke was mentioned in deut 13 as being the hebrew name for the creature of darkness. Therefore, this name was used with great care and with a very large number of meanings. This name is, of course, very ancient in its origins, as is mentioned by ezekiel. And it may be said that the greek ekel, 'god,' is an ancient name. There are several names in aramaeans as well, eka, kab, kek, hkek and eki, that can refer only to god or to his name or the name of his kingdom. Some of these names are in fact from ancient aramas.

            "\n",
            "1. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** The air we breathe contains tiny molecules of various chemicals, including VOCs. These molecules are responsible for the characteristic smells of different seasons.\n",
            "2. **Cold Weather:** When it's cold outside, the air is filled with tiny particles of gases like methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. These gases are produced by the Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere.\n",
            "3. **Warm Weather:** When it's warm outside, the air is filled with tiny particles of gases like ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and methane. These gases are produced by the oceans, vegetation, and wildfires.\n",
            "4. **Chemical Reactions:** The VOCs in cold weather react with the air to produce specific smells. For example:\n",
            "\t* Methane (CH4) reacts with water vapor to produce a pungent, earthy smell.\n",
            "\t* Ammonia (NH3) reacts with other VOCs to produce a musty, unpleasant smell.\n",
            "5. **Scents:** The specific combinations of VOCs in cold weather produce distinct scents, such as:\n",
            "\t* A fresh, earthy smell from methane\n",

            "[LLAMA Finetuned] The answer is simple: cold weather smells different than warm weather because the air is colder and there's less moisture in it. In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more. In cold weather, the air is much drier, which is why it smells so much more.  In the case of the nose, cold air is more dense than warm air, so it's more likely that the cold air is carrying more particles (like dust, pollen, etc.) into the nostrils. This is why cold weather smells so much more. In warm weather, the air is more humid, which is why it smells so much more.  It's also possible that cold weather smells different because the air is so dry that it's not able to hold much moisture. This would be why it smells so much more.<|eot_id|>\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~cold air can be quite different from warm air, and cold air is more dense than hot air.~~ cold and warm are caused by the temperature difference between air that is less dense and air with more density. Cold vs warm can also be caused from the fact that the air around you is colder than the surrounding air which is warmer than your body temperature. So, if you are in a hot or cold room, you can smell the coldness of the room. If it's cold, then you smell it, but if the outside air has a lower density than it has air from outside, it will smell more strongly. The colder the ambient air temperature, the more you will be able to smell a smell, even though it is in the same volume. In short, because there is a difference in density of air compared to air at different temperatures, your nose and throat will pick up more of a scent, which will then be perceived more by your brain.

            "[Answer] I actually just watched this demo less than a week ago. In the vacuum of space, they will get bigger because the pressure on the outside of the marshmallow drops, thus the solid part of the marshmallow gets pushed out by the gas in the marshmallow. However, these little pockets of air in the marshmallow will burst and the air will escape, so they will actually shrink a bit after they initially grow. You can watch the same thing I saw on [youtube](_URL_0_). When I saw the demo, they returned almost to the same size while still under vacuum, but don't take that as a definitive measurement on the net size increase. So, in summary, it grows, and then shrinks, so you're both kind of right. Pretty neat!\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The bigger the marshmallow, the bigger it gets. Answer: marsh mallows don't get larger. Question: why is the name marshman going to be so popular in the future? Answer: to protect the original marshmen who were the first marsh men. (and to help with the development of the \"marshmallow man\" concept)the marshmans are the only marsh marsh man in existence. The marsh mans who are to follow the story of \"marshman\" are:- the king, king's father, marshman - the marsh, mockingjay (who is also the king's brother, in order to ensure the survival of his people) - marsh man, and marshmenmocking jocks are all the same. They are marsh guys who love to play with marsh bars and marsh treats. Mocking jocks are not marshy. They are mully. In fact, they are so marshly that they can only be called marsh. What is a marsh?a marsh is an animal that is attached to a tree or shrub, or is hung from a branch, that can be easily removed or taken off. It is called a \"marsh.\" a marsh has two main types of muzzles: the head and the body. There are two types that are known to marsh: a head maul and a body mauve muffle. Both of these mocks can hold up to 40 or 50 marsh balls. A mule mike is considered a mooch. However, there are many different types, so you should ask the person who owns one of those types to check the other. If you have a good idea of what a particular mocking mook is, you can tell them. Just make sure you are checking the maunsel. When a person is mocked, he or she is \"stuck.\" he or her is not a real marsh, but is just a little mooted out, a part of a large marsh that has been mown. These moggings are called \"snowballs.\" when a snowball is left on a surface, it will fall off the ground, which causes it to fall into a pile. This is why the term marshball has a special meaning, as it means \"the snowfall.\" this type of snowballs are made up of several marsh pieces. Each marsh piece is made of different colors and shapes. When you find a piece that looks like a whole marsh ball, don`t leave it on your desk. Also, make a note of which marsh you found. Make sure to keep your marsh blanket and any other items that you may find on the floor. You can also find your own marsh cookie jars, ice packs, marsh cookies, mugs, etc. And even marsh pies. That is what you will find in a moochoo. For more information about mummies, see mummies in space . How do i know if i have been a marshmallow? There is no one right answer for this question. Some people say that their mama and baby will never know what is going on in their world until they get a chance to know their parents. Others say they will know the answers to this very important question if they have seen a picture of their dad or mom in front of them in real life. We have learned that the answer is simple. Ask your parents to tell you what the world is like in your day. Don`t let them tell the difference between a normal day and an actual day, because the day is different. All you need is to ask them what it is that makes you happy. Most people will tell a story about their day like this: \"i was born in september of 1969. My mom had a birthday party in her room and she had no idea that my dad was a big part. So she sent me to see my mom. I told her i was going for a walk with my dad. She said, \"you will be there when you get there. Do you remember what your dad said about you?\" i remember saying, 'no, no, i don�t remember it. No, my mom just wanted to talk to me.'\"i have never been in any of my life when my father was on television. He had to do a series of interviews to make it seem like he was talking about my mother. Then he went to the hospital and said his dad had died and that he didn�t want to hear about it because he would be out of town. But he never said anything about how he wanted my parents and i to get back to school.

It's not really a paper, though, it was an experiment that was done in the 1970s and the results are not well understood. It is, however, likely that marsh meringue is smaller than regular marymeringues. I don't know if that's true or not, since the article mentions that it may be that there are two types of marsh mold. Marsh and marshs, which are related, are both made from the same type of mold, and are in close proximity to each other. The latter is a type that grows faster and is more prevalent in marsh, while the former is rare. So the authors of that paper probably made the mistake of thinking that a marsh would grow larger than a regular marsh. Edit 2: found [this paper]( _url1_). Basically, marsh can grow to be as big as it likes, or bigger than it says. But marsh is not the exact same size. [but it looks like a lot of different marsh produce, so it has a smaller growth.]( _veriously).

Only some of the energy bound up in food is utilized by your body, and **none** of it comes from converting mass into energy. Your body takes chemical potential energy from bonds between atoms in your food and (after generally storing that energy in different chemical bonds) utilizes it to drive all the processes that keep you alive. Much of the actual mass of the food is used as raw material to make structures your body needs like new cells etc. Some of that material is used wholesale because your body can't produce it on its own (like vitamins).

            "1. **Protein content**: Foods with different protein contents have varying amounts of calories. For example, a serving of lean chicken breast (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 180-200 calories, while a serving of lean beef (around 30-40 grams) contains approximately 250-300 calories.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The body is always trying to find the right amount of energy for the body to use to maintain its health. The body needs to know if it has enough energy to function properly. The amount it needs is determined by the amount that is consumed in a given day. Therefore, if you have a high energy intake, you will need to consume a lot more calories to get to that energy. Answer: the calories in the diet are the number of foods that are used to make the meal. A low amount will burn more energy than a great amount. So, in order to have the optimal amount, the energy needs must be very high. If you are on a low calorie diet, your body must use as much energy as possible to fuel the metabolism. It is very important to choose the correct amount for your food. For example, one of my favorite foods is bacon. I used it as a breakfast for a long time and have been eating it ever since. But, it seems that the bacon that i am eating has a very low energy content. This is because i have not had bacon for over 5 years. You can read more about my experience at http://www.

There is no difference in calories, carbs, protein, and fat content between different types of meals. As long as you eat the proper amount each day, there is a good chance that you won't get any extra calories. Also, eating a higher amount does not make you fat. What is the difference between a lower amount and a larger amount? The difference is more important if there are two or more people.

There's more energy in a small amount of food, but the calories are spread out over a larger amount. And that is the big part.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think there is a fundamental problem with this notion of dimensionality. It has always been a popular view that the dimensions of a number are defined in terms of the number of dimensions in a set. However, in the past few decades, the standard definition of dimensionalism has been changed, and it has become increasingly difficult to find a precise way of defining dimension. Now, i think it is important to understand that in order to get to a better definition, one needs to take into account the fact that there are many dimensions, which makes it difficult for the same person to say which dimension to use. The problem is that a person who is using an external measurement is often the only one who can use it. This is why some people find it hard to define a dimension without being able to figure out which dimensions are actually used. This problem can be solved by using a simple mathematical model, namely a single number, called a square. A square is an object with an x and y coordinates. Because of this, it can represent any number in any dimension, including the one that is not a cube. But to do so, we have to include the square in our definition. For example, suppose that we want to make a triangle, but we don't know how to construct it, so we can't. So we use a mathematical formula to calculate the total number that would be needed to satisfy the equation. We then use the formula that can then be used to compute the x-y coordinates of each dimension in that triangle. Now, let's see how this works. Suppose we had a problem, that you need to solve for a specific dimension and then add it to the list. That is, say you have two triangles with different dimensions. One would have a different dimension than the other, because they are not the right size. To solve that problem we need a combination of both. In the example above, if we add the two triangle dimensions to our list, then we will get the correct number. If we do not do this in this particular case, our solution would look like this:x = 1y = 2here, x = 3, y = 4, etc. There are two possible solutions for this problem. Here is the first problem: we are going to divide by 2, add to it the dimension x, multiply it by a factor of 2. You may think that this is really a very difficult problem to deal with, since there would need be a lot of work to perform the calculation. I suppose you may be thinking that i am not so naive as to think this solution is correct. Yes, this may indeed be the case. Let me explain. First, you might think of it as solving for one or more dimensions by adding one to another. Second, a solution for each of these dimensions is going back to what the original solution was for. And third, there might be another problem that has a similar problem as the last. Now this does not mean that each solution needs a new dimension for all the numbers in it: it does mean there will be more than one. Indeed, for every number which has the appropriate dimension (a number with a certain dimension), there has to be an additional one which is greater than that. These are the generalizations of problem solving. As i said above for solving, each new solution will have different difficulties. When i say that every solution has problems, what i mean is: all solutions have problems. All solutions are solved. Each solution does have its own problems; and each problem has its problems when it comes to solving it itself. Why are we doing this? The answer is because there have been many problems that have never been solved before. Thus, some solutions do require a special problem which we now call a \"quantum problem\". In other words, they require the new problem because it solves for many more problems than it would otherwise have solved for it in its original state. Then, when we solve the problem for any of those solutions, all of them are also solved in their original states. After all, every new number is still the sum of all those numbers, even though we already have one new one in each state of our program. With this new fact, problems are always solved, regardless of whether the previous solution had been successful or not. Therefore, any problem may also be called \"normal\", or even \"supernormal\". Since it's always possible to have an infinite number and yet not have any problems at all in some way, such as being right or wrong, why not simply have the whole program solve all its possible problems and solve it all for you? Why not just have it solve everything for us?i would like to present a few examples of how the solution of every problem in my program is always the result of some special \"problem\" in itself, or a result from a particular experiment. Well, not exactly. Some problems have solutions which are\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~is it possible to have a finite number of dimensions?~~ yes, but the question is tricky. The answer is that we can't know what dimensions they are, or what their \"size\" is. We only know that the circumference of a sphere is the same as its diameter. But if we are able to say that a cube is a single-dimensional object, then we know the diameter of the circle. This is because we have already made an assumption that it is not a 3d object. So, we cannot know if it has a number smaller than 3. A 2d cube has infinite diameter, and a 4d square has finite diameter (for example). But we don't have any way of knowing whether the cube or cube can be described in the sense that they have infinite surface area. ______________________________ for a more general answer, the [wikipedia article](_url_0_) has some good information about it.

When you get a bit sick, those nerve cells are less stimulated, so your voice gets deeper.~~ edit:~~ i'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but i'd guess that the cold also stimulates the lining of your vocal folds, which makes your airway more sensitive. I wouldn't say that your actual voice is deeper, it's just that you have fewer nerve signals, since the airways are more restricted. Edit 2: i should also note that i've been wrong, that cold air can cause vocal chords to contract. The vocal cords are in a \"cushion\" shape, where they are still vibrating, although they have less nerve activity. This may be because of the way the nerve fibers are wrapped up, or it might be that they were damaged when the cord was cut, meaning they aren't getting the same signal. So the answer is that there's more nerve signal being sent to the brain, causing your mouth to open up. It may also be due to a few other factors.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] A country is something that is based on a certain set of laws and laws that have been enacted by a political party, or government or the people. A country can be a small country, a large country or even a multinational country. A government is not an independent country that operates under a common law of its own. A nation is an entity that acts independently of any government that has a similar constitution. A sovereign nation that exercises sovereign power can have its citizens participate in the government of a state, while a non sovereign country cannot. Some countries have an independence clause which does not have to do with the constitution or law but is used to set up a system of taxation. An overseas nation can only have a one-off taxation regime but cannot have the same one on the territory of an embassy or consulate. The rule of law is the law that governs the international relations of nations. A country in any of these situations is called a citizen. It has to be an international citizen of some country to have any rights or privileges. They have no legal right to control their own government. In some cases a member of the military has the right of self-defense but not to avenge himself on any other country for his actions. These countries are often ruled by their citizens but there is no right for them to rule any others. If a democracy is established, the governments of those countries will be made up of their members, not citizens. Democracy means that each government has its laws, and they are bound by them. This is also why democracy in most countries is ruled through the democratic process. All states are governed by laws. Laws are rules that govern the world. We are all governed in a democratic system. And a constitution is one of them, so we all have rights that are different from other countries. Democracies in other places have different laws but the laws they follow are the ones that we follow. How are democracies governed? We have laws in many countries but no laws for the other parts of our society. To govern one country as well as another means to take control of it. Such as in germany, france, italy, spain, greece and the u. S. Our governments have rules of origin and governance that apply to all people as they come into existence. Of course, we don't have all the rights and privileges that you might think we do. There are also some exceptions to this rule. For example in japan there's no law requiring a person to pay taxes. But in china you have strict rules about where you can and can't live. Not only does this not apply in your country but it's also not allowed in india, where even the police cannot enforce their laws without a court order. As you mentioned, as a result of this, you donwhat is your opinion of democracy? Are you against it? And if so, what do you think about democracy as we know it today?i am not saying that democracy does or should not exist. I am saying it should be something we should have. You may disagree with me on some things, but i think that most people are more or less right on this. That there exists some kind of moral standard that should apply across all of us. So what are some of your views about the \"good guys\" or \"bad guys\"? What does your view of that moral level look like? What's your position on what should and shouldn't be allowed or allowed to go on? Can you tell me what you believe about those issues? I can tell you that i don. No. I. Any. Or any person. (this is my opinion about things. What i believe is what we call \"the good guys\"). I am a democrat and i think democracy should live up to its moral values. Just because you disagree on something doesn't mean that it is right. Do not be afraid to express your opinions. Try to get some answers from others before you go against your beliefs. Ask yourself what kind (or how) your moral stance is. Can i say that i believe that a lot of people believe what they say, i do, that some people do and that other people don? Is that true? Do i agree with you? Or do people like me believe you are wrong? Does my moral position matter? If i disagree, then what? Then why am i different?

A republic is considered part an empire, though it may be governed separately from the monarch. So it can be divided up into two, although it might be independent of one king. In the end, you can't call a different country a \"republic\" if it has an emperor, as you're not technically an \"a republic. An english republic, or a province.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think it would be very simple to solve the problem by creating a fusion reactor in a vacuum. How would you generate a superconductor in an electric field? The first step is to create a new magnetic field. The second step will be to add a particle of the same type as the first. In the last step, we will add the magnetic particle to the other particle. This is called a \"spin-of-the-house\" field and is used to generate superconducting particles. We can think of this as a field of attraction that would not affect any other magnetic particles in the universe. The next step would then be the creation of a magnetic superposition of two particles, the second particle and the third particle, in which the particles interact to produce a single superparticle. At this point, it is quite simple. A particle that is a positive charged particle will have a charge that increases with the speed of light. It will also have an energy that will increase with increasing speed, so that it can interact with other particles at high speed. Then, a second, more powerful particle (the super particle) will interact and generate the supercharged particle in its current state. As a result, two more particles will combine and produce the new particle with a more effective energy. Once the fusion has started, this energy will need to be added to each particle's mass. By adding the energy of both the particle itself and of its mass, energy can be transferred to a different particle at the rate of one-half the mass of that particle which would otherwise be produced. With a large amount of energy, each of these particles can generate an amount that can then transfer to an entire system. There are many ways to do this. Some are simple:a super-conduction process (also called an electron-beam fusion)this is the simplest and most straightforward way to make a plasma. For this to work, there must be at least one way in physics to achieve a certain rate at which a light beam of an electrical charge is produced, i. E., the ratio of electric energy to mass (i. E., a ratio between a constant electric charge and a minimum electric one). The amount required for this is known as an atomic charge, and this rate is usually 1:1, but is sometimes called the electric-energy ratio. If you want to go from 1 to 0, then you would have to have at most 1.0. You can find the ratios of atomic and electric charges in this wikipedia article, which you can use to find out what the maximum electric and atomic charges are. I use the terms \"supercharge\" and \"antenna\" interchangeably. When you start to think about the electron beam fusion process, you will realize that the way this works is that you have two different ways of creating an atom: one, where you combine an ion of electrons with an iron atom, one where the electrons collide with one another, or two, when you create an electrically charged ion with iron atoms. So, what is going on here? The electron beams are produced by a process called \"exonation.\" the ion is formed by the interaction of iron ions with atoms of carbon and hydrogen. An electron has an antenna and an anti-ion. Electrons are formed when they are charged, as if by some process of magnetism. One of those processes is \"magnetism.\" as the ion interacts with electrons, they interact in some way with each other, resulting in ions, charged with ferromagnetic energy (magnetic radiation), that form the antennae. These antenae are created by being charged. They are called superantennas, because they can form superbodies of ions. Here is an example of how they work. Suppose you add an excess of hydrogen to your ion. That will make it larger and larger. Now the excess ion will form an anhydride, an organic substance that has a very strong magnetosphere. And if it are strong enough to form a strong antineutrino, that's why it has to bond with hydrogen atoms, to get the hydrogen ions to change their antigens. Since the anionic antenes are the ones that are able to break through the solid antines, their mass is very small, while their electric potential is much larger than that of ordinary antensions. How can you make an antenna with antenna? If the antuctor is composed of antineu, antox, oxide, etc., then it should be able use these anteneu to attract the ions and make them into an excited antox. But there is no such an object, since it will not be stable, will only become unstable as time goes on. Therefore, if the \"antenna\", which is in fact an electrostatic anticon, is made of antinoids, such as antin\n",

There”s a couple of things that you need to consider. First, you‘re probably not going to get electricity from fusion. This is because the energy coming from the fusion reactions is not coming straight from one source. Instead, it comes from two sources, one of which is a nuclear reaction. In the case of fusion, the reaction is just a release of energy. If you want to create electricity, first you have to use the fuel to generate the electricity. Then you add more fuel, and the more you do this, eventually you can‑t get any more energy out of it. You may have some luck with an [atom reactor](_url_0_) (a sort of nuclear reactor), but it's not very useful. Second, there are some things you don‹t want. For example, if your reactor is producing power, then there will be a lot of work to do. A high temperature and low pressure environment can also cause problems, because you are creating a large amount of heat (heat is the main thing that generates heat). You also need a very high pressure to start up the reactor, which can be dangerous for the reactors, but not too hot for other things. Finally, some of the fuels are probably safe to run on. The amount you might not be able to make the core, so the heat cycle is quite hot. Some might be radioactive, i don't want the [lots of other sources.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I've seen it happen to the person who is suffering from hypoglycemia. It's usually caused by a common cold, but it can happen when the body is not able to absorb the sugar it needs to survive. The solution is to drink a very large amount of water, then slowly drain the blood. In this way, the kidneys can help to process the sugars and convert them into glucose. If you can't get enough glucose, you have to eat a lot of food. This is because the cells of the liver are too large to handle. And if the glucose is too low, it causes the pancreas to become too full and the intestine to constrict. It is very difficult to get blood to your body. I've had people who have lost weight and who were able take a break from eating for three hours. They were just completely on the brink of starvation. Their blood sugar was so low that they could barely digest food at all. So they were dying of hunger. But it was a great relief to be able go back to eating and be alive. Why does your blood work differently if you eat only the carbohydrate? Answer: the protein in your food has to travel through the intestines, which means you must travel to and from the digestive system to digest the food you are eating. When you walk or run, your kidneys cannot digest it. You have a little bit of protein, and if your heart beats faster, blood flow to you. Therefore, when a person is starving, their kidneys have less protein and therefore less glucose to take back. That is why people with hyperglycemic syndrome, for example, are very prone to lose weight. What is the best way to break down carbohydrate in a human body?answer: if it's a carbohydrate, like sugar, there is no harm in eating it, so it should be eaten immediately. Some people say that this is best done in combination with a slow-release carbohydrate like glucose or fructose. Also, if there's enough protein or sugar in it to make the meal, some people may need to consume it for some time. There is also a low risk of kidney damage in some types of hypo-glycemic syndrome. One of my patients who was eating no carbohydrates for a long time, was very ill. She developed kidney stones in her kidneys. Her kidneys were full. He could not eat the whole food that he had been eating, because his kidneys had so much protein. Then he developed diabetes. For her, this was the last thing she wanted to do. After she died, she said, \"i need help. My kidneys are full.\" she could only eat about half of what she had eaten, with the rest being sugar. As a result, her body couldn't absorb all of it and so she was sick. Most people can go on to have diabetes, or some combination of both. However, i think that, in most cases, they can do better.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] _______my answer to that question is that i believe that the sun is responsible for the cancer prevention and control of cancer. I think that what the scientists are doing is putting a lot of effort into it. What i do know is, the sun is not a pollutant, it is the active agent that is getting some of the heat from the atmosphere.: http://www. Ncbi. Nlm. Nih. Gov/pubmed/20657778. Http. Cancer. Org/article/10.1038/a005029a. A... So what are some important things that we should know about the \"sunburn\" or \"chemical\" effects of smoking?in my opinion, there are a few things which are important for our health. First and foremost, you need to be aware that it's not just about smoking. It's about all of us and that's what we want to do. But we also want more than just smoking to stop cancer, because the effects are very real. Second, we need a better understanding of how the chemical and the burning effects from tobacco are being done. The chemo-and-chemical effects on cancer are complex and can be complicated. Third, most people do not know that smoking causes cancer and do, in fact, not understand that there is an increase in cancer rates in people who smoke. Fourth, smoking is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (and the incidence of other cancers) and breast cancer in women. Fifth, more people are becoming smokers and less of them are getting cancer treatments. Sixth, even though it seems to cause some health problems, what's really happening is smoking has a very negative effect on our bodies. Seventh, some people say that if we can get rid of tobacco, all we have to worry about is our body's cancer rate. Well, that might sound like a little bit of a stretch, but the truth is it doesn't really matter. We need more of what makes our lives better and more comfortable, whether it be smoking, using drugs or even using a drug, to make our life better. This is why smoking and other forms of physical activity are so important to us. If you don't have the right lifestyle, then you might end up getting a cancer diagnosis. Of course, if you do have cancer or don' like it, this is something that you want your doctor to know. In fact i would say if i was a smoker, i wouldn't get cancer because i'm not really interested in my body. Smoking is very important because it prevents cancer from getting worse and it can help with the symptoms and prevent other health issues like arthritis, diabetes and some other diseases. So, how can we help smokers get better? Well this article is one of many that has been published in the scientific literature, so it should be pretty clear what i mean. For starters, my goal is to explain what my research suggests. Secondly, as you read about it you will see that many of my findings are based on my own personal experience, which i will continue to share with you. Lastly, these findings will help you understand the impact that our \"sunburn,\" which is what a person can experience as a result of their smoking habits, can have on their health and well-being. Finally, please remember that as i have discussed in previous articles, many people may have different opinions about how to treat their own cancer problems. Some may feel that they are better off smoking than others. Others may be more skeptical about certain drugs. And others may think they can use a different method of treatment if they want. While i understand your concerns and appreciate all the research that goes into this topic, let me make it clear that in order to have a successful life, one must be able to overcome all obstacles and overcome the fear and anxiety of being sick. When i say i don`t want people to get sick, who do i really mean? I am not saying that people should avoid smoking; i just want them to understand what they might not be prepared to deal with. My goal here is simple: if your body is healthy, healthy and healthy you should do everything in your power to prevent or reduce your cancer symptoms. You will have an easier time having a normal life.\n",

This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and infrared, which is why the sky appears blue.\n",

            "\n",

The Earth is about 30% of the total energy of the Sun's light. The Earth receives 4.3 watts of light per square meter, while the Sun receives 136 watts per square meter. This means that the Earth receives 30 times more light than the Sun, but it receives only about 1/5 as much energy. So the Earth is brighter than the Sun, but not by much.

Dust is a very dense gas and it doesn't absorb as well as sunlight * light from the sun is reflected off of it * a little bit of the heat from a solar storm can cause the ground to look dark, but that doesn’t really mean it‘s actually dark * sunlight is blocked by the same stuff that causes the dark sky * you can see stars in the sky from space * space is much much more reflective than earth so the light hitting the star is more easily blocked * there are lots of stars that are brighter than the sunlight that you see, so it looks darker * stars are much farther away than they appear to be * so much of space has more sunlight, the air is less dense and less reflective, and the stars appear brighter, you get less light than you would expect from sunlight hitting you, which means the shadows are less bright.

            "\n",
            "1. **Multiplexing**: Satellites can use multiple transponders or transmitters to share the same frequency band. This allows them to handle multiple simultaneous connections by transmitting data to different receivers simultaneously.\n",

            "4. **Satellite Constellation Architecture**: Modern satellite constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper Systems, use a constellation architecture that allows multiple satellites to work together to provide global coverage. This architecture enables satellites to handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiple transponders and transmitters.\n",
            "5. **Software-Based Satellite Control**: Many modern satellites use software-based control systems that can handle multiple simultaneous connections. These systems can dynamically allocate resources, such as transponders and transmitters, to meet the changing needs of the satellite.\n",
            "6. **Satellite Communication Protocols**: Satellites use specific communication protocols, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) protocol, to manage multiple simultaneous connections. These protocols enable satellites to handle multiple simultaneous connections by providing a framework for data exchange and resource allocation.\n",
            "\n",
            "To illustrate this, consider the following example:\n",
            "\n",
            "* A single satellite can handle multiple simultaneous connections by using multiple transponders. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) uses multiple transponders to provide a constellation of satellites that can handle multiple simultaneous connections.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think the most important question is how to make it possible to communicate. The satellite is a great tool for this. I have been able to connect satellites from all over the world in a few days and i am very happy with the results. The next step is to develop a system that will be able keep satellites moving at a high speed. Let me be very clear, i do not think that you need to have a satellite to transmit information. You need a solid foundation in which to operate. The problem is that satellites are very expensive and a lot of them don't have the same quality of data that a typical satellite has. It is important to be clear on what you are talking about. If you want to keep the data moving, you should be using a radar. A radar is not a big deal, but if you have radar, then you can keep it moving. There are a number of things you could do. First, if the radar was used for the satellite, it would be useful to know what satellites were involved in the transmitting. This information can be used to build a real-time, accurate, and reliable system. Second, an antenna would provide a good antenna to take the signals from the satellites. As far as i know, there is no satellite system to store that information in. Third, the amount of time a transmitter needs to do this is very small. In general, satellite communications work very fast. But if it is only a couple of seconds, or if there are several satellites, this can become a problem. Fourth, satellites can only transmit a certain amount in one direction. Even if a one-meter antenna is used, that is an extremely small amount. That is why we are not using satellites in this way. We are using them to provide information to the ground. So, in my opinion, we need satellites to receive and transmit the information as well as the signal. For a long time, many people have looked at satellites that can transmit data. They think it will take some time. These satellites do a very good job at transmitting information, they are quite small, so it takes a little time for them. Yet, when they do transmit, their data is going to move very quickly. To keep a spacecraft moving while transmitting, one needs a small antenna. One should use small antennas, because they will stay in place for a short time and they can do very little to hold the spacecraft. However, for satellites with a large antenna, even a tiny antenna can provide very useful information that the user can use. Finally, a antenna should not be put into a hole. An antenna needs some space to fit into. With a larger antenna in an area that does not have space for its antenna and it needs space, something like a two-way antenna will fit in there. At the end of the day, these are the types of satellites we should get. Next steps:how to use a radarthere are many ways to create a network of satellite systems. Many of these systems are called \"radar systems\" or \"systems with radars.\"radar systemsi would like to start with an example. Suppose that we have two satellites: a uhf satellite and an icbm satellite. Each satellite will have three antennas. On the uf satellite we will use two antennas to send data from one of those two satellite's to another. Then, on the icb satellite the two antenna's will transmit two signals. Since we want a \"high frequency\" signal, our antenna must be the one that sends the high frequency signal to our ground system and the other antenna has to carry the \"low frequency\". What we see here is the following. Notice that in our icm system we use one antenna for each of our satellites and two for our three satellites (as we mentioned above). We can also use the antenna that carries the low frequency signals to control the antennas that are attached to each satellite (this is called a single-band antenna). Since the single antenna carries only one signal it can't be a main antenna on one satellite or a central antenna (which we call a dual-subsystem antenna) on another satellite . So, what do we do with our satellite?now that i understand what we were talking, let me start by saying that if we could use our radar to monitor our land and sea movements, why not use it to detect the presence of foreign land vehicles? The answer is because our radar will tell us if any of that foreign vehicle is there and if so, where. Our radar will also tell what type of vehicle it was. Therefore, any foreign car that has a gps, telemetry, radar or other device that might be on our surface can tell our system what is happening. (for instance, gps can identify a road, such as a highway, to a vehicle that doesn't know where it has parked. Thus, without a strong gps system, all\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the signal from one satellite is sent to another satellite in orbit~~ !!!~~ satellites send signals to each other too~~ (i. E. When the satellite crosses the earths orbit, it sends a signal that changes the orbit) satellites are in orbits that are elliptical, meaning that their orbit is not straight. The reason why satellites don't always cross is because there are a lot of things that can cause satellites to cross. For instance, the way satellites communicate with eachother is by bouncing off of the atmosphere. That's a big problem when they're orbiting at such high speeds. So they usually send a message that says \"i'm in the middle of a very elliptic orbit!\" that doesn't really matter, because the satellites just know what's going on.~~ this is just one example of how satellites can get around this problem. Edit: spelling. (sorry if i'm wrong.) edit 2: thanks for the correction. I was actually making sure that the words were correct. It's important to remember that satellites always have their own orbits. They need to be in free fall, and not in an elliptized orbit. This also means that they are always moving at a constant speed, so if a satellite goes out of orbit they will always experience a correction to their orbits, which is very rare. There will be a delay in that time. If they go out in a elliptically shaped orbit the error will occur. But the correct answer is, they have to avoid the drift. As a rule of thumb, when a new satellite gets closer to the centre they get closer, its time in their orbital speed will drift will go up to zero. And go into the center of earth's orbit will also drift down. Hope that is the answer will not be correct! Edit 3: as the best i said by no correction is that a side note, there is no. Its also true. A simple correction means they don’t have a fixed distance. Sorry, just a error. Some satellites have an orbital period. Or it‘s always a small correction, but not always the orbital distance is fixed. Also, a drift in orbital periods are the same as any other error of orbital. Correction in its orbit and a distance, i‍m correct, an error in correction always in distance and the difference in time, also. _url_0_ _the answer. You can also have correction for drift, if the distance from the source. In space is zero, not a difference. Any correction at all. An example.

No extra calories. Only a little extra carbs. At least i would eat less. The plan was good. But i had to make some changes to my diet that would make it more stable. First, the food. This is where i learned a lot about lipoprotein metabolism. Lipoproteins are a type of protein that is produced by the pancreas. They are located in your intestines and are responsible for the body's metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. When a fatty food is ingested, it is converted to protein. As the fat and carbohydrate in that food are converted into fats, they are transported to the liver for processing and conversion to carbohydrates and fats. If you eat too much fat, your body is unable to convert the fats in those fats into glucose. So, you are burning more of your fat as the carbohydrate is metabolized into carbohydrates, and that happens in less time. You end up with a lower level of glucose in blood and you lose a much higher level in fat. For this reason, lipolysis is also a good way to decrease your blood sugar. And the process of lipogenesis is very important to maintaining your weight. (i'm not saying that i need to add a weight and gain weight every day, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no such thing as \"losing weight\" or \"stopping weight\"). ______ how to lose weight _______ --------------- i always advise you not to worry about your health. Some people have a low carb diet and they don't want to be on a diet with high carbs, such as a high fat diet or a ketogenic diet (which is what most people are doing). But, there are some things you can do to maintain your overall health: 1) eat more fruits and vegetables. 2) limit your sugar intake. 3) stop eating processed food such like processed meats, fish, eggs, etc. 4) start eating healthy fats like nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. 5) avoid processed foods. 6) don't add any processed fats to your meals, because it will cause the digestive system to burn more calories and cause you, in turn, to over-exercise. 7) do not add processed or high in saturated fat (saturated fat). 8) try to avoid processed and high cholesterol. 9) if your doctor tells you that you have to stop eating certain foods, make sure you know what to look for in a variety of foods to help you maintain a balanced diet on the right diet plan. 10) use a safe, low-calorie, high-protein, healthy diet like this one: https://docs.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] ********** if you look at the statistics of the us population, the number of dogs that are estimated to be between 8 and 12 pounds will probably be around the same as the numbers of wolves in the uk. If this were to happen, then we would see a total of 13,600 wolves within the next 50 years. Of course, there is a huge difference between the wolf size and the average size in a given population. For example the great white, a large wolf, has a very long tail and weighs about 2,000 kg. The average length of a wolf is about 5.5 metres, and its maximum height is 2.4 metres. So the mean size for a typical wolf population is around 1.6 metres in our case, but for wolves that live in remote areas such as central north america it would be less than 1 metre. In fact, it is estimated that the population of wild wolves is just over 1,500. (in fact it may be estimated as low as around 2 million.) this means that wolves will be able to live for about 10,800 years, with a maximum lifespan of 2 to 3.1 years and a minimum length that is less a mile than that of our average human. This is quite a big difference, though, so it makes sense that we should keep it close to a target size. And it also means we can do a lot better. What about the european wolves? They are large, hairy, well-muscled, very well adapted, large in size, strong and well rounded, have strong, broad, soft, smooth, big, tall, short and thick, long and short, dark brown, white and brown. They have a great deal of fur and they have lots of feathers. What about them, is it possible that they are able or willing to carry the weight of their prey without the risk of being eaten? Answer: they can. To put it simply, they may not have the strength, size or stamina to run. Their diet is usually of animal products and most of them are not very fit to hunt. But the amount of meat they eat depends on the species they live with and on what they do forage. Wolves can be very large and very fast, weighing as much as 15 tonnes. Most are small, which is probably why they usually have very big heads, or large eyes. Other wolves have to eat a wide range of food in order to survive, including some that have great fur, like bears, wolves, leopards, dogs and wolves. There are many other species that can easily be seen as being able-bodied wolves (such as bears and dogs) but there are also wolves who are very small (like bears), which can have extremely large heads and have big eyes, such a problem for the large head of one. It is possible for large wolves to have quite short tails and this could be because they need to stay close together and stay in close contact with each other, thus eating a wider range. Some large carnivores, for instance, hunt and are quite hard to spot and may have large noses and teeth, while others hunt for food and often are seen hunting in packs of several people. I do not know whether these are the wolves we are talking about here, as there seems to not be any scientific evidence that such behaviour is common. However, if we assume that this is the case for all large predators, we might be looking at an animal that has been successfully bred to keep in contact. We could imagine a scenario where wolves are as small as dogs, small and fast. Or perhaps we could assume the big wolves were able and willing enough to move around, even without having to dig a hole or dig through thick forest, to find food, shelter and to fight off predators. Either way, these animals would have been quite large. When we look into the possible reasons why large dogs are so fast and agile, i think we get the point. Why should dogs be fast? In general, many people think that dogs have speed, agility, strength and intelligence. That is not the truth. All animals are born with many different skills and abilities. At the end of time, humans have all the tools and skills that humans need. As long as we maintain this level of human understanding of animals, this will continue to change. By the time a human is 70, he will have learned more and more of what is necessary to maintain human abilities in his body and mind. A lot of people do this for fun. Dogs are like that. Animals that need a good fight are most often humans, especially the small dogs. People have always been able, in part because of this knowledge, of how to defend against dogs in different situations.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~i don't think we can, but maybe it is an interesting question.~~ there are several theories on the genetic origin of size in humans, including the idea that we evolved with our size and that it was the result of an evolutionary pressure from our ancestors. There is also evidence that humans have had a small brain (and therefore, less muscular) for a very long time, so we could have selected for the small size, and our brain evolved to be able to do so. It's possible that this may be what caused the big brain, which is why we don’t have the large brain we do. Edit: i should also point out that the wikipedia article on size is incorrect. The article is only about the brain and not the muscles. _url_0_ _edit 2: [here](_url__0__) is a picture of a human skull. That is not a skull from a bear. I dont think it‘s possible the human brain was selected to have a large size. My guess is that our brains were selected because it would be easier to grow in a cave with more muscle mass than a larger brain. A big skull has the same advantage over a smaller skull, more muscular brain in the cave. So it has to fit into the skull and also fit inside. This skull shape and size as a bone. Maybe our skull is the best way to survive. We didn— live in caves, it also has more brain size because our skulls are the smallest brain which would help us survive the longest. Sorry for that some things would have to evolve. If we were able have larger skulls. But it wouldn“t, that's not, our bodies are more in smaller skulls, smaller brain has a bigger brain is more efficient and larger than our muscles, maybe larger muscles to fill in and smaller. They have bigger bones. Our heads are less efficient than the brains. And so a brain can survive, the head is just a good thing. Probably not. No other animals have smaller brains and bigger brains, too small. All animals can„ survive more than that. Please correct me if i‖s what i said. :) edit 3: _besides the other big, we have big brains for something else. Not small, there‚s the fact that evolution of our big. [we have more muscles for muscle. Size that can also help a lot.](/naturally. Also larger brains can be selected against. Lots of muscles and have small brains because of large brains too. In some animals. Evolution. As the bigger animals is very important. Humans didns ancestors didn't have large, because they had small heads. Smaller heads and therefore bigger heads too, they evolved. Some people with big heads, some of them also have less brain too large. Therefore big and thus big too big for it can have size too (for bigger head. Hence big head and brains are not too size which gives us bigger.) edit 4: and this is what happened is in answer. To answer by size it all points it came from what? Smallness. For some. Because a creature that would not be the biggest. Small but the most creatures have very small head, small to a size also survive and survive a life, its size was better for. Bigger creatures that was bigger and survived. Larger head = bigger, as it goes on and got bigger it evolved faster. Most of the creatures evolved too and grew. Tl. Didnt survive evolution was a survival of smaller, then big/larger. Life. Now it didn. Big creatures did not evolve bigger to become bigger too powerful. Creatures with a head bigger body, bigger size did evolve as big as long as needed.

Why did creatures evolve to bigger things grow. Is it get bigger so big? I can't survive to life? The smaller as we get smaller than what it got big it grew and die. Never grow and become smaller?

            "\n",
            "[Answer] \\They don't do it because they don't see the point. The real power in NATO comes from the US, so as long as the Americans keep up the spending, they're still golden. Not to mention, since the end of World War II, Germany has generally had a rather pronounced anti-war stance, so having a large army isn't exactly a popular choice. That said, it's not really fair to make fun of Germany in this regard. NATO has, what, 28 member states, and only about 5 which meet the 2% minimum. NATO is already *significantly* more powerful than any other military force on the planet, so it's kind of hard for most countries to justify ramping up military spending they'll never actually use, when they could instead put that money into social services.\n",

            "[LLAMA Baseline] Germany's reluctance to increase its military spending and size is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Here are some key reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Economic constraints**: Germany is a member of the European Union, and the EU's economic policies, such as the Single Market and the Eurozone, have led to significant budgetary constraints. Germany's defense spending is a small fraction of its GDP, and increasing it would require significant increases in taxation or other means.\n",
            "2. **Historical and cultural factors**: Germany's military history is marked by significant defeats, particularly during World War II. This has led to a cultural aversion to military spending, and many Germans believe that a strong military is not necessary or desirable.\n",
            "3. **Fear of nuclear war**: Germany's experience with nuclear war during the Cold War has led to a lingering fear of nuclear conflict. This fear has contributed to a reluctance to increase military spending.\n",
            "4. **Comparison to other NATO member states**: Germany is often compared to other NATO member states, such as the United Kingdom and France, which have larger militaries. This comparison can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",
            "5. **Lack of a clear defense strategy**: Germany has not developed a clear and concise defense strategy, which is essential for NATO member states. This lack of strategy can make it difficult to justify increased military spending.\n",
            "6. **Bureaucratic and institutional factors**: Germany's military bureaucracy is complex, and changes to military structures and procedures can be slow and difficult to implement. This can make it challenging to increase military spending.\n",
            "7. **Focus on economic growth**: Germany's economic growth strategy, known as the \"European Economic Area\" (EEA) and the \"Schengen Area,\" prioritizes economic growth and integration over military spending.\n",
            "8. **EU budget allocation**: Germany's contributions to the EU budget are significant, but the allocation of funds to other areas, such as defense, is limited. This can lead to a perception that Germany is not doing enough to fulfill its NATO obligations.\n",

Http http/ httpthe only real difference between brazil and argentina is the fact that both countries are in the same country. The second country has the better military but the third has no military at all. In other words, argentina does not have the superior military. However, in spite of this, both have been in close cooperation with each other since the beginning of the current conflict. Argentina has been a close ally of brazil since 1999. On june 4, 2012, brazil signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with the two countries on the development of military cooperation. This agreement was signed on june 18, 2013. It has since been implemented by the brazilian military since 2000. A number of issues have arisen between argentina and brazil regarding the military and the relationship between the countries. One of these is that brazil has a much more powerful military than brazil. Brazilian defense minister eduardo paes said in a press release that the brazil defence minister had \"converted to the position that he should not be involved in military affairs because he is more concerned with being in control of his country's defense than in being a member of a country that is not part of it.\" another issue is brazil's military is far more expensive. According to a brazilian defense minister, the cost of brazilian-argentina military units is $60 billion a year. Brazil is also one of two brazilian countries that have signed an agreement with a french company, f-4 phantom, to build a fighter jet.

            "[Answer] By some measures, outlawing of popular recreational drugs results in considerably more societal ills than if we just regulated and taxed them. Because drugs are illegal, they are used to fund organized crime all over the world; they force partakers to get involved with shady people; they are not sufficiently researched for their effects on human health; they are not regulated, so people end up buying and injecting all kinds of horrendously danger chemicals; they continue to fuel the very expensive and very ineffective \"war on drugs\", which results in prisons full of people who've committed non-violent, victim-less crimes.\n",

            "1. **Medical Use**: Many people believe that the medical benefits of certain substances should outweigh their potential risks.

            "\n",
            "7. **Scientific Research**: With the legalization of all drugs, scientists could focus on studying the therapeutic potential of substances rather than their potential risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Reducing Police Power**: The war on drugs has led to a significant increase in police power, which has contributed to mass incarceration and racial disparities in the justice system. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from policing to public health.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Addressing Socioeconomic Inequality**: The war on drugs disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities. By legalizing all drugs, the focus could shift from addressing socioeconomic inequality to providing equitable access to healthcare and treatment.\n",

Legalization is the change in the laws of the state. It does not change the legal status of drugs, but rather it changes how the government regulates them. People who oppose legalization, like the republicans and the tea party, want to change how states regulate drugs so that they can function. The problem is that the legalization of all the drugs is going to create a huge amount of money that will be spent on research and development and on the treatment of addiction. So, to solve the issue of drug abuse, the people that oppose the drug laws want the money to go to research, development, and treatment. If the federal government takes the time to regulate all these drugs (which is what the current government is doing), then it will make the system in place worse. In addition, drug abusers will often have to pay for their treatment and will get the additional treatment that's available to them from the prison system. This will increase the cost of treatment for those that abuse the illicit drugs themselves. That is why people have opposed the recent legalization. Tl;dr: people want more money.

            "[Answer] You can't look at Benham's disk on a monitor and know what color you \"would\" see on the real thing, ironically enough for almost the exact same reason we see color there in the first place. With a real-world disk, we see colors because some of our eye's receptors fire faster or linger longer than others - So a rapid white/black transition favors whatever receptors send the strongest signal back to the brain. Think of it like a poll - \"Hey red, what do you see?\" \"Umm, something, I guess...\" \"Blue? What about you?\" \"Yeah, something bluish\" \"Green?\" \"YES, oh wow, yes, dude, you have to see this, so greenly awesome, hey can we stop at Taco Bell later?\". Going back to monitors, you can't (necessarily) see the right color because it will depend less on your eye and more on which color of subpixels in your monitor has the longest retain time - Frequently red, for LCDs.\n",

            "It seems like you're referring to the \"Hubble Deep Field\" (HDF) image of the Andromeda galaxy, not Benham's disk. The HDF is a famous image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Here's why not everyone sees the same colors:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Different wavelengths**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). The HDF image captures a range of wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. However, the human eye can only perceive a limited range of wavelengths, which is why colors appear differently to different people.\n",
            "2. **Filtering**: The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to capture images in a specific range of wavelengths, which was called the \"optical passband.\" The optical passband is a narrow range of wavelengths that the human eye can detect. Different wavelengths are perceived differently by the human eye, which is why some colors appear more vivid or muted.\n",
            "3. **Color perception**: The human eye has a limited range of color perception, which is known as the \"color gamut.\" The color gamut is determined by the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Different people have different sensitivities to these wavelengths, which affects the colors they perceive.\n",
            "4. **Interference and absorption**: The atmosphere can absorb or scatter light in different ways, which can affect the colors we perceive. For example, the atmosphere can absorb UV light, which is why the HDF image appears more blue than it would if it were taken in space.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the colors we see in the HDF image are not necessarily the same for everyone because of the differences in the wavelengths we can perceive, the filtering capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limitations of human color perception.<|eot_id|>\n",

But what i find most interesting about them is that they all look the way they do, and it seems to me that there is a real balance between the different colours and the various properties that make them so different from each other. [re: [post]] reply: well, you just donyou really dont have to think about it as a matter of fact. A lot of people have seen a disk that looks like it had been painted. You just can't see it. For example, if you looked at a normal black disk and you saw that the blackness was not very bad, that would be a pretty good picture. Or you could see a black screen with a red background and a green background. So, even though you can see the screen and there's a nice contrast between them, the contrast is very poor. That is, it doesn't make any difference to the image quality of your computer when you see them in real life.[re-post:] i agree with you. When you read a book about a machine, do you think that it has a good color scheme? If so, then why does it look like a bad one?you know, when i read books, my mind is just like that of an average person. People say that their minds are like this. My mind says, \"this is good, this is bad.\" but when they look into the computer, they have this bad image, or the bad aspect. They look in to this image and then they think, maybe this picture is better than this one, but it isn't. The computer is like, okay, what is it? That's what they say. And the truth is this computer has this good aspect, which is not good. However, there are people who do this, who think this thing is really good because they see how good it really is. This is what you have. Because they don`t see that, because there aren`ts like these, people are not able to understand what it means. Therefore, in my opinion, a picture like some kind of computer screen is worse than an ordinary picture, to be honest. As far as i can tell, most people see this as the best picture that can stand up to them if they use the right tool. To me, some of them are a bit bit confused. Maybe they just use a different tool, like an old computer monitor. Anyway, while i understand that these things are good things, why do people think they should use this kind, especially for a laptop? To be fair, these are things that i would like to see in computers, where you would have a more accurate understanding of what the difference is between a desktop and an \"interpreter\" (i. E. The machine that is running the program). In that case, would you prefer the laptop over the desktop? For a long time, we used to say, no, those were bad things. Nowadays, our opinions are different. We have different opinions, for example. Sometimes people say they want a better computer because of this machine. No, sometimes, good people want to use computers that are better. Some people like them because that's their way of doing things and to make money. Others don�t like those machines because people dont care about the fact that computers are bad. These things should not be used in such a way. Those are the opinions of those who have never seen this sort of thing, so i have no idea why people would say it was bad or that. Besides, as far, are there any differences in what people use? There is no difference between those two opinions. What is interesting is you are saying that in most computer screens, color is used. Well then, can you show me something like what that means? I want you to show a white screen. On a blue screen, on a yellow screen you might say \"what is your view of that?\" or it might be \"i like white.\" you can show them that you want them to look more like blue. Your computer does not have that feature. Instead, your screen uses a combination of white and black. Why do we use that? Because the whites have the opposite effect, whereas the blacks have something more in common with the white. One might wonder, how can we know that a color in a screen can have an effect on the other?\n",

The Earth is a big ball, and when you look at something in the sky that is very far away, the Earth will look to be moving in the sky. The distance between the Earth and the object is called the parallax, and when you measure it, you can calculate the distance between the Earth and the object. The problem is that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the distance between the Earth and the object can vary, so the parallax method only works for very far away objects. The most precise way to measure the distance is to use the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is a number that tells you how fast the universe is expanding.

The first thing i want to see is the distance between the center of the earth and the earth. I know that some people think that distance is important but i find that this is just a way of measuring distances. The second thing is that the distances between two planets are not exactly the same. The distance that you see on a moon and a satellite is not a good measure of distance. It's a matter of making sure that we're measuring the minimum and maximum distances that are possible, as well as the total distance of a planet. So let's take a look at how we get the average distance from a point to a distance to the point. The average of each of these distances is 0.5 ㅜㄠ㎦ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ so what is this? Now the closest distance we can get from earth to mars is ~3.8 ㅋ so the next thing we need to do is determine what distance the planet is closest to. And that's the first step. We need the following measurements. To find the nearest point, we have to find a minimum distance and then we find an absolute distance in the space of our planet that is equal to our minimum. A minimum is an actual distance, and absolute is a value that tells us where the object is. In the case of mars, the absolute value is 5.2 so the relative distance (or the approximate distance) is: ʼ ɛ ̄ ͡ ˌ ˈɡ n  𝐲 」we can find this by using the formula ƒ ө 관 ᵒʒả , where ҫ is relative and ᴫ ℇ  � ǐ ȟ ⁴ ᵇ ᴄ ᶕ ῆ ₨ 𠀽 ṣ ḥ фɯ ﷤ ห ὄ  。 ḳ � � ̶ ക̀ ẓ ַ ༼ ἀ̇́ ┓ʷ̈ ・ ो เlet's use 《 主 、 今、 南 使 级 不 你 沫 囨 学 寀 宮 人 只 封 名 勦 深 便 乙 巯 康 懐 带 迃 的 交 徃 觀 賶 山 忦this is where we start.

You can see the effect of these forces in everyday life. When you pour water into a glass, the water will take the shape of the glass. This is because the water molecules are interacting with the glass molecules.  To get a better sense of the strength of the van der Waals forces, look at the [Mie scattering](_URL_2_) of light.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] Yes, and in fact, the two things that are in the same place on the molecular surface of the molecules are the \"two objects\" and the atoms themselves. So the question is: how does it happen that two molecules interact with one another and then get into the state of being of one other? I think it is very important that you understand the basic concepts of molecular chemistry, that is to say, how molecules form and what they do with each other. If you are thinking about how the other molecules come and go, you will not understand what happens to the chemistry of those two particles. In fact you can't. The chemistry is what matters. And we need to understand how these two substances interact and how they interact in order to be able to interact to produce the physical reality of our universe. We also need a lot of time to learn about the interactions of atoms, molecules, water molecules and more. How do these interactions happen? In other words, what does the interaction of an object with the chemical reaction of two atoms do?what is the action of a chemical compound? What does its action mean? Answer: the molecule acts as a catalyst. It binds to a specific chemical bond and creates a molecule. As the catalyst, it makes its own chemical bonds. When you break one of these bonds, there is a reaction taking place, which is called an \"exchange.\" the molecules in this exchange are not just the ones that have the right reaction partners, they are also the one that has the most chemical energy. So if the reaction partner has more energy than the catalytic partner, then the exchange is happening. This reaction is not a single chemical molecule, but the three chemical molecules that interact. Now if you were to break the bonds of all three of them, all the reactions would be taking over. But if your reaction does not have this energy, your molecules will have no energy at all. A chemical exchange has nothing to do (with) the energy that the carbon atoms have, because they have all been released. You can say that this is because the bond of three molecules is that of carbon, so you have to make that bond. Well, if they can no longer exchange, their molecules have not been exchanged, thus they don't have any energy whatsoever. Therefore, this reaction can only take place if it has a high energy reaction. That is, as the hydrogen atoms are released, a hydrogen molecule is released (that is) in a very high rate. I believe that we are going to see an increase in these reactions in our future. What is important is if we have high-energy reactions, we can create more reactions. One of my favorite things to discuss is how to create an energy-free system. Answer, i would like to talk about energy systems. Energy is something that happens when we combine two or more of different molecules. First of course, some of us are very busy, many of whom are involved in manufacturing and processing a particular molecule or molecule type. Second of note, when you combine three or four molecules together, one molecule can take the place of only one. However, even if one and one-half of your atoms come together in one atom, two of you, or even three, are still in contact with it, since you want to get rid of it. Some molecules can be separated by just one bond, while others can have more than one, though it can still take a few molecules to separate the different ones. Thus, in theory, energy can act as an independent property of molecules as well as of matter. Also, once you get the idea that all of this information can go through a process, why dont you start thinking of energy as something we could all create, something you could control? For example, lets say you wanted to control the movement of four hydrogen molecules with hydrogen. Because you would have a situation where you needed to use hydrogen to move four of their atoms to form hydrogen, to increase its energy and to change its molecular structure. Then you might want a way to deal with that problem, such as creating a fuel-cell that would release hydrogen into space. There is nothing wrong with such an idea, although you do need some work. Let s say we want the first hydrogen-based fuel cell to work, with a pressure of about 1,000 psi. To do that, just start by creating the gas and creating all that hydrogen that can then be used in space, including the fuel. With that gas, our hydrogen needs to have enough energy to release the oxygen that our molecules need. At the end of that process you should see that your hydrogen is now going through the process of hydrogen bonding. Finally, any hydrogen you create in an oxygen-filled atmosphere will be released by the atmosphere. Once you put that inside of yourself, no matter how much energy you use, nothing will happen to you. All you need is some energy or a combination\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~yes, but not in the same way~~ it's the [tetrahedron effect](_url_0_) that causes you to feel the effects. Think about a ball of lead and a bowling ball. They are both hitting the ground at the exact same time, so they will both hit the bowling balls at exactly the right angle to hit each other. But in a microscopic sense, they both have the effect of hitting eachother. It is the tiniest bit of friction that is actually causing the difference, and the microscopic friction is only noticeable if the ball is hit by a moving object. So the answer is no, it does not really matter. The molecules that you're touching are the atoms in your body that are moving at a high enough velocity to exert enough force on you. If they were stationary, you wouldn't feel anything. That's why you can't touch a rock. You feel it because the rock is moving faster than the electrons in it. Edit: the word \"touch\" is a misnomer. \"tendency\" means \"interference\" in quantum mechanics. There is an interaction between atoms and molecules, which is how they interact. In that sense it doesn't matter if you are touching something, because you don't notice the interaction. I just used a word to make this up.

This makes them less aerodynamic and reduces the amount of maximum potential imparted by the weapon.  The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here.

A bow on a person's shoulder can be aimed with the bowstring tension. A crossbow is mounted on a wall or a tree, which means the crossbow string has to be pulled back before it can be fired. In addition, crossbows have a more consistent rate of fire. This is because the crossbow string is pulled back before firing, and then pulled back again to load the next shot.

It is an extremely powerful weapon that can kill even the best of the toughest enemies., but if you use the bow like a man, you can easily be defeated. In fact, it is a very good weapon, because it gives you more experience and experience points than you would with any other weapon. A bow will deal a lot of damage, so if it doesn't have any damage output, the hunter will be left with no choice but to use it. The bow has a special special ability that allows it to be used for a long time, which is called \"bow of defiance.\" if you take a bow, then you will have to kill a large number of enemies, and there will only be one shot left. This ability is also known as the \"crossbow of life\" or \"the crossbow\" in some games. \"you can use this ability for 30 seconds.\". I have been playing the mod quite a bit, since i thought i had found a way to make bows that were more effective. However, i feel like i don't know enough about bows to know how to change the parameters, what makes them better or worse, or what the effects of a particular bow are, when to buy them, how long to put them in, etc. So i am not able to tell you what i mean by this mod. As far as i know, there is no reason to go to the trouble of changing the properties of bows, nor is there any reason for you to just make a new bow for every game that has one, as there are no games that have the ability to have them all. ______________________________________________________________________________________, and i will post more information about the changes i made to bow descriptions later. A lot has been written about how bows are not just a weapon for hunting. But, in order to really understand what bows do, one must understand that bows can be made from any kind of material. You can have many different materials, from wood to stone. If a certain material is used, a different bow can also be crafted, by a specific person. Many of you have seen the videos of hunting bows and said that a person can make one bow. They can only do so much with such a material, they have no idea what it's made of. And it can take years to create a single bow at any given time. What a great idea, this is where we have all the information that we need to start thinking about what to do with bows. Some people have said \"it can't be done\", because bows only have one purpose, to hunt. Not only that, bows also have special abilities to deal with certain situations. For example, arrows are a kind and useful tool for many purposes, for example for dealing with the enemy, hunting, shooting at enemies and the like. Bows are also used to shoot arrows, on the other hand, some people make arrows for other purposes. One of them is to hold a crossbow with one hand and a stick. These arrows can shoot, can fire arrows and so on. Also, with a high level of skill, making a bows bow of high skill is very easy. There are two types of arrows that you are able with: \"high\" and \"low\". A high arrow can hit a target with its arrow, hitting the target twice, before it explodes. Most of your arrows will explode when you hit the targets target, at the same time that they are hitting each other. Thus, all arrows with high damage are capable of exploding at a higher rate than a low arrow. High arrows also deal more damage with their arrows. Hence, if one of those arrows is not hit twice by the arrow with low damage and it still explodes, that one arrow is capable to hit for the rest of its life. Low arrows have higher damage. Therefore, many people will try to get a more accurate idea of what an arrow's damage is, like \"he is going to die when he shoots a shot with his high arrows\". This will sometimes cause the arrows to explode. Because of this, people often make their bows in many ways. An arrow will shoot at an enemy in a straight line, while it will also shoot a arrow on a side, against a wall. Even the highest arrows get hit with arrows on their side. When you kill enemies with these arrows you could also kill them with your bow and arrows in their bowels. That's how many bows there have, even with all of these different arrows being shot. Although the low arrows do not explode, most people do. Moreover, high and low bows still have their damage dealt by their arrow in them. We can say that high bows deal much more than low ones, thus, their power is much higher than the damage of their high, low, bowes. Well, these\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~crossbows are made of wood and have long range.~~ bows are very light, and they don't have much recoil. They also have the advantage of being a relatively inexpensive weapon. That's why they're called bows. The bow itself is made out of the same material, the crossbow is a completely different beast. Edit: i think that the confusion is that a bow is meant to be a weapon that is aimed at a target, rather than a straight weapon like a cross. A long bow, for example, can be aimed with a short arrow. So a \"long bow\" is not aimed for a specific target. It's aimed to hit an arrow, as the arrow is the main target of a shot. This is why the longbow has a shorter range compared to a rifle. You can't aim a single arrow at the target as well, since the rifle is designed to fire from a distance, not a fixed point. But the longer distance allows for more rapid fire, which means that it can fire faster, or at least longer distances. However, a musket, made up of copper, is much lighter, so it is more difficult to aim at. Also, it needs to have some form of an effective crosshair. With this, you need a larger cross, that can also be pointed at an enemy. -------------- edit 2 more: the short range, compared with shorter ranges, this can have shorter ranged, but can reach a lot more distance. There are many more arrows, longer ranges. I know that they are not made with longer ranged. Not just cross bows, also the archers are more powerful, like the muskets, with long ranged weapons, they have longer reach. As for the other weapons. For bows they need to cross their range and a large, their bows with wide range is longer. And longer, too short ranged and are for crosshairs, because they can aim. Like rifles. Archer, bows can go up and long, ark, both. Short and musks. _url_0_1_ so there is some of these are longer and shorter. Tl: * ar and arket and rifle, short. * bow and cross bow are better. Bow. Longer is good for weapons are also bigger, bigger. **short range for their cross is better for long weapons too. Long cross or longerrange, great for arker. Bows and bows both of ar. Now it also more effective, bow have better range *shortrange. Cross and range of arrow and arrow range are good. Sorry, longrange for pointing, better cross are the point, _short ranged for longer bows... But ar is easier to target with short ranges... _long range... Shortrange is just as long as it was, arrow... And some are a good weapon... *not very good at aiming at long ranges and more accurate. No arrow! Ar, good cross also not very long... Also bow/arrow is very heavy. Source: _bow, heavy, some people say it takes longer to shoot... I'm sure it will not hit the enemy at all. Because it has much longer cross arrows.

To answer your question. :) source : _the short answer is: short distance... Ar are both are they both short, wide, to get a point of both rifles and rifles, are designed for one thing, neither are.

            "[Answer] Ignoring air resistance, the forces on the balloon are gravity and buoyancy.   F = rho_air * V_balloon * g - m_balloon * g where rho is a density, and g is the gravitational acceleration. We can also write    V_balloon = m_balloon / rho_balloon so   F = m_balloon*g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) Newton II says F = ma so   a_balloon = g*(rho_air/rho_balloon - 1) in other words, the balloon acceleration upwards depends on the ratio of densities of the surrounding air to the balloon contents. It will have an acceleration upwards equal to g if and only if rho_air/rho_balloon = 2 -- if the balloon is half as dense as the surrounding air. This is also ignoring any expansion or compression of the balloon as the outside pressure changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "[LLAMA Baseline] If it weren't for air resistance, balloons would indeed rise with the same acceleration as gravity. This is because air resistance is a force that opposes the motion of an object, such as a balloon.\n",
            "\n",
            "When a balloon is inflated and rises into the air, it is essentially in a state of free fall, with an acceleration of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s^2) due to gravity. However, air resistance acts in the opposite direction, trying to slow down the balloon.\n",
            "\n",
            "If there were no air resistance, the balloon would continue to rise at the same rate as it would if it were in a vacuum. This is because the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object, so even if the velocity is the same, the force is reduced.\n",
            "\n",
            "In other words, if there were no air resistance, the balloon would rise with the same acceleration as gravity, but it would also rise at a much faster rate than it would if it were in a vacuum.

            "However, it's worth noting that even in a vacuum, there is still some air resistance to consider.

If you had a balloon that was attached to the ground, and you had a fan blowing on it, it would rise. But if you had a balloon that was attached to the ground and you had a fan blowing on it, it would fall. The reason for this is that the air is not the same on the ground as it is above it. When the air is above the ground, it is moving in the same direction as the balloon, so the balloon rises. But when the air is below the ground, it is moving in the opposite direction to the balloon, so the balloon falls. So it is the difference in the direction of the air that makes the balloon fall, not the difference in the air's density.<|eot_id|>\n",

The other interesting thing to note is this is a question that's been around for a while, but this one has gotten more and more interesting. I believe that the answer to this question is the following:1. There is no way to determine the acceleration of the balloon. 2. It's not possible to predict the trajectory of a balloon due to gravity. 3. If you were to give a straight line to a plane, it wouldn't be possible for you to know the trajectories of balloons, which are extremely difficult for the human eye to see. 4. Gravity is not a good thing. 5. In order to measure the velocity of an object, you must measure it. 6. Air resistance is an important factor. 7. When you measure a particle, there are many particles in the vicinity. 8. You can't really tell the distance between the particle and the air. 9. A particle will never be able to move in any way in this direction. 10. To measure air, we have to go to the ground. 11. This is why we can only measure particles with air or with water. 12. We don't know how long the particles will last. 13. At the moment of measurement, the speed of light is 1.8 billion times slower than that of air and 1 billion to 1,000 times faster than gravity, so it's going to be difficult. 14. I'm not sure how many people have asked this, and i don' think they've ever asked it, because it sounds like a lot of people do. 15. That's because gravity doesn't work that way. 16. What if you measured a large particle in space with a light beam? 17. How many times would the light have travelled? 18. Would the beam be in a way that would have blocked the way for light to travel? 19. Is there a thing that can determine that? 20. Maybe it will be known. 21.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ive never heard of balloons being pushed into the atmosphere. I would assume they would. This is how rockets work. They have a large exhaust pipe and air is sucked in. The exhaust is pushed out, and the rocket launches the fuel. It is then pushed back in again. There is no air to push back. Gravity is the force that keeps the balloon in the air. You can see this in a [video](_url_0_) of a rocket going up high in space. If you were to blow on the top of it, it would go up in air and back out. However, if there was a sudden change in gravity the rockets would have to take a little longer to reach the surface. So it depends on how fast you want the balloons to go. But i can't imagine there being any significant effect. Edit: i am not sure about the [gravity on a balloon]( _url_.

(edit 2) the reason it doesn't have the actual answer to the aerodynamic effect of gravity. Which is probably the size of the gas. Not just gravity, as mentioned. In fact, the effect is that the lift of air pushing it up. As it goes up, gravity does. To get out of shape of things. That's why the helium and a gas can be compressed. More dense. Air pressure. Or a much smaller answer (or more air density. Same air with air at the bottom of that is pushing air as the wings. > pressure in those wings, which can push the wing. ) the change direction of force is called air downward. Just like gravity on it also pushes air up and gravity in reverse. A bigger balloon. Think about a long way. Basically, more weight. Then the amount of fuel, fuel is pulling it down. Its the back to space (in the opposite direction that gravity of what gravity causes the drag of falling down and pushing down is gravity pulling back is what makes it rise. Thats why you pushing the ball up to speed. Fun fact that if i could go into a small hole. At a certain altitude there's air then gravity it wouldn't move faster and more gravity and so the gravity you would be pushing back and push it back, same way the ground.) so there isn't really only a gravity there. Like the velocity. Note also air does the shape. Now, there are also a good question. Why would the speed of lifting force. What is drag. Drag is different in rocket. When the iss is in vacuum. Does not gravity pull down the direction and lift the plane. Of space is pressure? Gravity's gravity pushing up the earth. Answer the height. Where the problem is air in it push.

In a gas or liquid, the atoms can move freely bouncing around off of each other, while in a solid that atoms jiggle back and forth in place. When you rub or hit two objects together some of the kinetic energy of the movement is converted into more jiggling of the atoms in each material.

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~the heat comes from the friction, not the heat itself~~ the hotter it is the slower it heats up, so the more heat it has, the faster it gets. The problem is that heat is an energy transfer, that is, when you heat something up it takes energy to move it, but when something is moving it doesn't take energy at all to do so. So in order to get heat from something, it needs to be moving fast. In the case of friction the energy in motion is lost as heat, and the kinetic energy is then converted into heat. This is how hot things are. Edit: spelling. I know this one, because it's a word. Sorry if it was an odd word, i'm just trying to make the point clear. A heat transfer is a process of kinetic and kinetic conduction. Heat will flow when it moves, heat flow is just a way of saying \"you move faster than the speed of sound\". So when a person is in a car going 50 mph and suddenly the air is pushing them, they feel the same amount of heat as they would if they were in air. But it turns out they don't feel it at the moment, since they're moving at 50mph. _____ edit2: i forgot to add that the word \"heat\" is not just \"move\". It means \"flow\". Heat can be converted to heat in different ways. By moving faster or slower. When i say heat has a different meaning. That's not a motion. It can also mean \"moving\" by changing its a change in speed. As in other words, speed, which is speed is energy. Motion, a movement. Not speed that changes speed can mean speed change. And movement is also change (speed. If a difference. Its not time. An object moving is something moving. Kinetic. All the movement, like a moving slower than speed means. You can move fast or slow. (move fast moving by something that speed in some other, its motion which does not move. Speed (and time changes. Movement in space. Moving with motion in matter. Like an air, movement speed changes things change things. Something else. For example, motion at some motion (as in heat) speed are also changes in temperature. These are heat and temperature (air is heat that has speed and heat are different things have. Things move in thermal energy (time). It changes friction. Light and motion happens. Time moves faster. Hot is movement of things (space). Edit 3 times the answer is \"it takes heat to flow.\" edit3: this means that means it doesnt change speed or heat (heat to air). The thing that does change and time is what it does. Think. Is kinetic (like moving). This works the hot thing moves. Air moves slower, hot and slower things work. Slow moving things slow, air move with heat changes (other things do not) edit 4: it will heat up. *move faster, faster movement causes time, or time and you move at a speed the temperature is different. Wind speed a faster thing is all in all things being hot. > speed moving the time when the person feels heat moves and they can feel heat or cold, time change, fast movement that can change the other things speed speed also moves speed when they are moving, just like speed which changes the things in moving does movement when moving to the fast, etc. Basically. To speed up or down. Meaning that a friction is no movement does the meaning of motion and speed does heat speed(heat. Energy). Its just the transfer of energy changes energy which heat move when someone feels its movement the way they move or a thing. Or the difference of moving in time (in air and air do the stuff. Just changes when its moving through heat the something. They change energy and energy does move speed as speed at speed it. Fast and move the rest. T is one thing, friction and not heat change movement (also. Which has heat/speed). Which speed by friction all heat does time as well. Same thing all that causes heat travel and that move is friction with time does (or heat edit1. Change its speed edit 2: heat when heat which change as fast as light movement or movement happens it take time to movement and space to light. Thats speed all. There is like motion when things that moves in water. Does light speed light (same speed you are motion) it just as time in spacetime. Other stuff is motion it all moving and things heat movement to motion like light, light is stuff the move which causes the water and light moves air they just move, then the one way or speed they both heat by gravity. Friction causes a light it when moved. Also heat(speed is temperature changes how fast is caused by the wind. Everything is moves so they cant move like heat you but heat anything, all they speed things at different and can heat everything they a ball a. Because of air the\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] The most important thing is to see the differences between the two countries, as well as the historical and cultural differences. The nordic countries were a melting pot in the early 20th century. They were ruled by a feudal order that had ruled for hundreds of years. It was a peaceful society, and the feudal system was very much in place. However, it was the ruling class that ruled. And it wasn't the working class who had the power to change the rules of the system, but the peasants. That's why the nordic people wanted to break feudalism. It's not just the peasant that's left. In fact, the people of denmark, sweden, finland, norway and iceland are all part of that system. The people from those countries who have been in power for centuries are now part people. So, to some extent, there's an old feudal aristocracy and a new feudal society. But what about the workers who were left in a few centuries ago, or those who are in positions of power today? What about those in charge of industry, that you think have a lot of influence in our society? Answer: in a sense, we have very little influence. We don't have the same influence as other countries. Our government has a very limited role in many areas. When we want to improve our country, our government is very important. I'm not saying that the government should have to be the only one. If that were the case, then we wouldn't be able to do anything. As for the economy, what's the role of our economy in this country? The economy is the main focus of this whole country. There are a large number of people who work in factories and factories. To put it simply, they are very active in business and in agriculture. Because we're not able, in general, with any other country to have an independent economy. This is a big problem for us. For example, one of my colleagues is working in an agriculture company, which is one day in, right now, a factory. He's working on the ground. You can't just go and sit in his factory and just watch him. Even if you had a good day, you couldn't even go to the factory to get a food. These people are not very good at agriculture, so they can be very hard workers. At least, i would say that they're very poor. What do you say to those people? What are their main interests? I can tell you that we are working hard to solve these problems. All of us have our own interests. And what do we do about it?well, if we didn't work hard enough, this would not be a country that was ever going to live. People would look at us like we were crazy, like they were trying to kill us or something. Well, those were our people, all of them, who wanted our help. Those were people that wanted freedom. Some of those things were good, some of these things are bad. Sometimes people will try to make things better, sometimes they will just give up, because it's hard work, especially when you don. Look at how many people die for no reason. Do you know what they want? They want freedom, freedom from all kinds of problems, from death to education. From death, people want some sort of freedom and some kind of independence. Why would they fight for that? Because they've got to, after all, make money, their children have no money. No matter how hard they work. Let's go back to your own experience. First, when i was in college, many of you were saying, \"how can we be so free?\" well- i just wanted a little freedom for myself. My parents would be in prison for a long time. One day i asked my mother what she wanted, she said, 'let's do this.' and i said that i wanted my freedom to go. Then, my father said to me, ''well- this is what it means to give a damn. Give a goddamn, give your freedom back. Your freedom.' i could not believe it. After all the years of living in denmark and sweden and all that, even though i had to work for ten years and go all over the world, still i still didn�t give an fuck. Just giving up my independence, giving my life to what i believed in. Don't you want that freedom? It�s not like you can say, `i want a better life. Now i want the freedom of doing what you said i should do. Stop fighting for it and try again.' you know, at the time, most people would have said: 'we need a more freedom because we know we don�re going through this. How can you\n",

            "3. **Collectibility**: Manga and anime are often collected by fans, who purchase individual volumes or episodes of a series. This creates a strong sense of ownership and community among fans, who share their love for the series with others.\n",
            "4. **Educational Value**: Manga and anime are often used as educational tools in schools, where they are taught as part of the curriculum. This has helped to popularize the medium and make it more accessible to a wider audience.\n",

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think the best way to describe this is as a kind of an open-ended question. I'll keep that in mind for now, and i'd like to give a little context. When i was a kid, i used to have a very limited range of keyboards. My mother's was the first, so she was very interested in all of my devices. One day i picked up a new keyboard. She said, \"i want a full-size, all-caps, super high-quality, hard-wired, full, touch-sensitive, high quality, flexible, soft, non-slip-stretch, usb type-c, one-handed, with a 100% compatibility.\" i didn't understand why. So i went to a shop and bought a keyboard that was just a bit smaller. It was really good. That's where i started, because i don't know how to type. And that's what i did. So i took a look at the keyboard and it was so simple. What i like is that the keys are very much like a regular keyboard, but they are also very tactile. The keys on my keyboard have an almost tactile feel. They are tactile and very precise. There are two different keys, the \"pinch\" and the thumb, which are more tactile than the regular keys. We have one on the left and one in the middle. On the right, you can press a lot of keys at once. This is a really nice touch. You can even have your whole body pressed in different places. For example, if you press the f1 key, it feels like you are in a car. Because of the way it works, when you have the finger on your keyboard you feel it, as if it were in your hand. In fact, that is what it is. If you look closely at what's on there, there is no touchpad. At the end of that, a thumb is not an important part of what you do. As a rule, we have to use our thumb to hold our keys so that we can use them in that way. But i think it's very important that you use your thumb and your fingers to make sure that it does not move when it comes to things. To be honest, for a while, no one used the touch pad. Now that i've talked about the experience, how it worked, what the pros and cons were, let's look back at that experience. Let's start with the fact that there were actually two keys that were very different. First, they had a different feel and feel than a normal keyboard - they were not in sync. Second, not all the time. Both the second and third keys were different, in fact. Right from the start, both of them felt very similar to one another. Even when they came in contact, neither of us had any issues with them. Of course, since it wasn't a problem, my family never had problems with it. All we had to do was change the key. Our family used a hardwired keyboard (which we still use today). I'm not sure if that makes sense. Since that time, people have used keyboards that are not compatible with our keyboard software. However, this keyboard is very well suited for the modern pc. __________________i guess i had the same problem that a typical user had. A few years ago i made the decision to switch to the full version of windows. From the look of things, after a few weeks i realized that this would be the last version that would support windows 8.1. Here's why: first of all, windows 7 and 8 are both available on windows 10. Microsoft also offers a preinstalled version called windows update, available for purchase at microsoft store. With the new windows, users can download it from a pc and run it on their own computer. After the installation, microsoft provides a service called \"windows update.\" it's an online service that allows you to download updates for windows to windows xp, vista, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and windows server 2003 r2. These are the versions that get the most updates. While the newer versions of these software are free, many users will pay a small fee for them, to be able to play with their existing software in new environments. Many of those users are using windows for work, or simply because they love it and want to get their hands on it - just to try it out. It's important to note that windows has a couple of major problems. Firstly, while the windows operating system is open, its software is still limited. (the microsoft edge browser is available, although you'll have some issues when trying it at home.) secondly, most users have problems running the operating systems. Unfortunately, though, some users still have issues using their windows vista or windows 2000 operating-systems. Sometimes\n",

That's how they were developed. They are not designed to be used in a way that is not a more efficient way for typing. So the q10- and q11 were used by typewriters were the most common, and were not common. And so-and they just used for typewriter typeers. Keyboards didn't have more than q. You can't even had different ways to write qrs, for typed more common typewrites. It, q keys.

If you place electronics in alcohol, it will reach all the tiny corners where water is hiding and mix with it, “diluting” the water. Then the alcohol evaporates, so the remaining water is now spread out over such a large volume that it evaporates quickly as well. The detection strips rely on a hydration reaction with water.

When the alcohol is absorbed into your skin, it is absorbed into the water that is dissolved in your skin. So, when the alcohol is absorbed into your skin, it is absorbed into the water in your skin.

As the alcohol evaporates, it causes oxidation at the enzyme responsible for making the sugars. The enzymes responsible, however, are unable to act on the yeast as they degrade and become alcohol. To avoid the oxidation, a yeast needs to break down the enzymes in the fermenting process and the resulting alcohol will become more difficult to digest.\" i think that is a very interesting answer. It is an excellent way to see what the reaction is going on. It also helps to know that alcohol does not have to be pure to work. I have found that when i was cooking, i would use a lot of sugar and i wouldn't want to add too much to the dish. The next step is to make sure that the ingredients are dry and to ensure that they are not too wet. First, we need to find a suitable way of drying the wine. Here is my idea:1. Use a small amount of vinegar to dry the entire wine and add the dried ingredients to it. 2. Add a tablespoon of water to one of your pots and boil it for 10 minutes. 3. When the water is cool, add some water from the pot to your wine pot. 4. Once the hot water has cooled, pour in a bit of wine to mix with the vinegar. 5. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes to allow the solution to settle. 6. Remove the pots from their boiling position and allow to cool completely. 7. Allow the grapes to sit overnight in your refrigerator and then store in an airtight container. 8. Enjoy!how to make aged wine (wine-yard)i hope this helps you.

For example, alcohol makes you less likely (or even impossible) to clean something. However, in a dry environment, the alcohol isn’t dry. So the object that was previously wet has dried out.~~ edit: the word \"dried\" is a bit misleading. Dry means \"not dry.\" alcohol is not dry at the molecular level. Water is. This means it has more energy than just water, but it is still wet. In alcohol, there is less energy in the liquid and more in it. The more water there, more stuff will stick. That means you won‘t be able to wash out things, and the stuff that you do is more difficult to remove from the body. Edit2: it sounds like you misunderstood your question. Alcohol doesn't just dry stuff out, that stuff is also wet, which means the things you are cleaning can also get stuck. **edit3:** the question is what you mean by “dryness”.

So, no matter how many times you try to break the \"rules\" or how much you fail to follow them, i will still help you. Step 2: if you think that you can get away with it, do yourself a favor and sign up for a free account. A free one is a great way for you to learn about reddit and how it works and get started. Now, if it's not free, well, why not sign it up and give it a try? This will make it much easier to set up your own account and start your new life. Then, the best thing is that it will be free.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] It's a problem because it requires an organization to be able to \"re-think\" itself. It's also a bad thing because if you have a system where you can't license a news agency that has been exposed as a lie, you would be out of business. I've seen many people in the news industry who've been told they have to stop reporting on stories because they were exposed for breaking news. They don't want to. This is an issue i think needs to go much deeper. If you look at the way news is used and manipulated, the more people are exposed to it, and the less they believe in it. When the media's reputation is taken away, it's not only less of a press, but more of an ideological, corporate media. The truth is, if there is one thing we can all do, then it is to make sure that the truth isn't out there. And that's exactly what i believe about the need for a media that is open to all. But i don' t see how it can be done without changing the rules.\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ive heard that the rules are that reporters are not allowed inside the building. I would guess that you would also be able to report the truth if you have some sort of legal obligation to provide the information. That being said, if a reporter is going to lie, it's important to know the facts. If the story is untrue, the reporter must be held accountable and the result of the investigation must go to a special prosecutor. In some cases, like the one in the movie \"the hunt for the mole,\" the police have to get a warrant for a specific area, and then they will ask for that specific warrant to investigate. This is because the search warrant was issued by a judge, not the media. It is a matter of fact that a newspaper is allowed in a building, but not in any building in which a journalist is permitted to be present. The news organization has to have a lawyer present to testify in court. Edit: also, in case you're wondering, no, this isn't about *lies*. The laws of war are different than the law of international relations. There is no law against lying, because war is illegal. So the only laws against lies are relevant to international affairs. A war can be applicable to war. No laws that apply to lying. For war, war must apply only to non-war. War for non war: war and war in international law. Just like war cannot apply for peace. Also war applies to any war if war *if war has a law that war or war (or war between two wars. You can't apply even if it applies for law, that law to all war? The same law applies even though you know war with war... War that's different laws apply. And vice versa. To no war without war depends on war the war - war you are laws. Even war only war laws in general. Both of nations can apply laws between war apply in war may be illegal, though there are rules. Tl;dr: you must declare war against war to rule.

            "6. **Diagnostic Criteria:** The diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities are different. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) distinguishes between learning disabilities and intellectual disabilities, with the former being a more specific category.\n",

A learning disability is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to process information. An intellectual disability is a disorder that affects the brain's ability to learn.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] This question is a bit of a mystery. I can't really tell you the answer to this question because i'm a neuroscientist and i've always been interested in the subject of learning. But i think there are a few things that are relevant. First, you may be able to learn from someone who has been trained to do so. Second, the person may also be aware of the social situation that they are in. Finally, people with learning disabilities may not be well informed about the kinds of things they need to know. The problem is that the question of whether or not a person has an ability to read is rather fuzzy. In the literature, a reading disability is defined as one that is limited to a single set of abilities. So a disability that has no set abilities is not considered an intelligence. And it is difficult to say whether it's an iq, or a physical disability, because we know that most people who have learning impairments have no ability at all to use these abilities as they actually do. If you have a developmental disability with a number of talents, it would be possible for you to be very good at reading, but that doesn't mean that you are not able. It might be difficult for some people to understand that their abilities are limited, and they might not even be capable of doing so at the level that one would expect. The same goes for a mental disability: it might mean you don't know what to expect, even if you do know it. Some people, like me, have trouble with this sort of thing. However, i do think that there is an enormous amount of research that can be done to better understand the brain. There is so much to study and so many different kinds. We've all had to deal with it in different ways, so i would say that some of what we're doing is really fascinating.\n",

Learning to speak, write, speak at a high level, or speak in a foreign language are considered learning disabilities. A child who cannot learn to read or write is not a learned person. The term is used to refer to the inability to understand or understand speech in an abstract way. You can be a genius, an accountant, a scientist, but not have the capacity to be intelligent.~~ edit: spelling. Spelling is the ability to think, think abstractly, and think logically. For example, i can't understand how to draw in the paper, so i have an ____ disability (not a neurological disability, just a developmental one). A person who can understand the concept of a word is an amirite (the ability of an individual to communicate with others). The word \"amir\" is a form of intellectual impairment, meaning that it lacks the skills necessary to become an engineer or engineer. I'm not sure if that's what you mean, though. Edit 2: grammar. Grammar is like a language. So the way a sentence is written is just like how you speak. If you have a grammar defect, it's like an english language, the sentence you are speaking in. It has a different meaning. However, if someone says \"i'm deaf\" in english, that means you're speaking \"you're deaf. This means i am deaf, this is my deaf.\" so \"this is deaf\".

I have always been a little nervous about my body, especially my joints. However, with this new drug i started to see that my pain is not going away. After a while i had this idea. My joints are starting to feel better. At first i thought i could just use a pain medication. But then i realized that i really don`t want my arthritis to go away because i do not want it to be too big. The more i try, however, it gets worse. Now i know how i need it and i see it as a means to my health, to alleviate my symptoms. What i am trying to do is make my knees feel more natural. That is, my thighs. My ankles. That is all i need. All i really need is a big toe. The only way i feel like i could change my feet is if i use my legs and my arms. And i just keep trying. It just keeps getting worse and worse, until i finally get a small toe that will fit in my shoe. Then i feel so happy, because my toes are so natural and perfect. Then i go to bed and get up and start my morning routine.1. Have you tried any of these other drugs? If so, how have you felt about them all? : the first time i tried them was in the back of me. A few months ago i did a lot of research and found out that they can make your body feel much more active and full. They also can increase your immune system and help you fight infection. And they make you feel really strong. Some of their symptoms are: headache, nausea, numbness and shortness of breath. Also, there is more of an anti-inflammatory effect than a placebo. These drugs give your muscles more time to grow and contract. Your body is so full and supple that this helps you heal. A lot depends on how much you put in your diet. To increase the body's immune response, try these drugs :- buprofen,*bupropion,*lentrone,methionine, tryptophan, prozac, vibram, triclosan. Use these for a long time. (i used them for about 8 years.)2. How do you know if these medicines work? Do you see any side effects? How would you describe them to your doctor?

It basically means that when you take two pictures at the same time, you will see each one of them as being 3 dimensional. So when the movies are being shown at different times, the picture will appear to be 3 dimensions. And when they are shown over and over, they will look like 2d.

            "1. **Melanin**: Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color. There are two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is responsible for brown and black skin colors, while pheomelanin produces red and yellow skin colors.\n",
            "2. **Genetics**: Skin color is determined by the amount and distribution of melanin in the skin. People with darker skin colors have more melanin in their skin, which gives them a darker hue.\n",
            "3. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to sunlight can cause melanin production to increase, resulting in darker skin colors. This is why people from tropical regions often have darker skin colors.\n",
            "4. **Evolutionary History**: The distribution of melanin in the skin is also influenced by an individual's evolutionary history. People from regions with high levels of melanin production, such as the Amazon rainforest, have more melanin in their skin, resulting in darker skin colors.\n",

            "**Early beginnings:** Girl Scout cookies were first introduced in 1917 by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The first recipe was a simple chocolate chip cookie made with just a few ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and chocolate chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Quality over quantity:** Over the years, the Girl Scouts refined their cookie recipe, focusing on quality ingredients and careful baking. They used high-quality chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract to create a rich, delicious flavor.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Quality control:** To ensure consistency and quality, the Girl Scouts developed a strict quality control process. They tested their cookies in small batches, using only the finest ingredients and a rigorous testing protocol.\n",
            "\n",
            "**No shortcuts:** Unlike some other cookie manufacturers, the Girl Scouts didn't rely on shortcuts or preservatives to extend shelf life. Their cookies were baked fresh daily, using traditional baking methods that preserved the natural flavors and textures.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Attention to detail:** The Girl Scouts are known for their attention to detail, from the packaging to the branding. Their iconic brown paper bags, colorful labels, and \"Treat of the Month\" promotions have become synonymous with the brand.\n",

            "2. **Lack of transparency:** Companies may not disclose the exact ingredients or manufacturing processes used in their cookies. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for consumers to trust the product.\n",
            "3. **Preservatives and additives:** Some companies may use preservatives or additives to extend shelf life, which can affect the natural flavor and texture of the cookie.\n",
            "4. **Shortcuts and automation:** Companies may rely on automated production lines or shortcuts to save time and money, which can result in cookies that are inconsistent or lacking in quality.\n",
            "5. **Focus on profit over people:** Companies may prioritize profits over people, focusing on mass production and cost-cutting measures rather than investing in quality ingredients and careful baking.\n",

They also don't allow any additives, except for salt. They also make their own sugar, and their own flour. They also bake their own cookies in small batches, and they have a very low turnover rate. This allows them to keep their cookies fresh, and they also keep the cookies from getting stale. They also have a lot of control over what goes into the cookies.

Htmlthe last question is the one about how to make good cookies (the one where the cookie is made and what it does). What is good cookie?so let's look at the cookies we make and how they are made. To start, let me start with the good and bad cookies:i have a few things to say about the bad and good. Bad cookies are the ones that are almost always made from sugar, sugar-free, or even a combination of both. Good cookies will be made of a variety of ingredients, most of which are not used in the traditional cookie making process. In fact, they usually make a lot of the things that make up good food. But they also have to do with how the food is prepared. For example, it is usually a good idea to use the best ingredients for the ingredients used to create good foods. I will also mention that these ingredients are usually not added to the recipe, so they can be added in a different way. The good thing is that good ingredients like sugar and water are often used for all of these. This is why most recipes that use these are still made with sugar. Good cookies come from a number of sources. One of them is from local farmers who are using sugar cane, which is also used as a substitute for butter. Another is a company that is using a mixture of sugar from cane and corn. So when you make the same cookies twice, you will have the right mixture. However, the difference is, when it comes to making the exact same recipe twice (and it will not be the way you would like it to), it makes the whole recipe much less effective. And, that's why i use a much better recipe. Here are some of my favorite recipes for making good biscuits. You can also see the recipes i make with other ingredients such as butter, milk, eggs, spices, etc. In my book, the good, bad, & unhealthy cookbook. What you see above is just a small sample of what i do, although it has been a long time since i have made anything like this. As for how much to pay for these, i am not sure. Most people will pay a little more than $5 for a cookie, for example. Some will even pay $20 for an extra cookie. Other people may pay less for them, depending on their taste. That is not to mention, if you are a restaurant owner, your employees, employees at a local restaurant, workers at your local grocery store, a family member or friends, even some employees in your neighborhood, many of whom will probably pay you a bit more. If you don' want to have these cookies, dont buy them. Just buy your good ones. Let's say you want a recipe like the above. There are many good recipes out there, just like here. It is really not necessary to know every single one of those. Also, try to get as many as you can out of your home. Don't just buy everything you need. Buy what you really need and make it as good as possible. When you find the perfect recipe for your specific needs, make sure you buy it in bulk. Your store will usually have it. Now, as i mentioned above, there are always people who will want the most from their cookies and will need to buy more for their special needs. They will find a way to save money and don`t want their money going to a store. A good store usually has a freebie on sale. These stores have an \"ask a store\" section where they will give you some coupons for free cookies for specific items. Sometimes they even have some free coupons. Usually, these coupons are listed in order of how good the product is. Ask a place where you live, what kind of products you like, how many you have, where it goes, prices and other details. Be sure to ask them questions. Do not ask any of this on your own. Even if they do ask it on a regular basis, ask questions to see what they think. Tell them that you think it works. All of you. Good luck.\n",
            "\n",
            "[GPT2 Finetuned] Ian kershaw has written a lot on this subject in the past. You can read the entire thing [here](_url_0_). Basically, companies are trying to make money by selling cookies to people. The company that makes the cookies is trying not to lose money but to get people to buy the product. That's why some companies do this, to sell to their customers so that they can make more profit. Other companies have other ways of making money, like by giving you a coupon to use at the store. This is how the girl scout cookie company got the name recognition and other publicity. Edit: to add to this whole thing, when you buy a cookie from a company, it is a part of their profits. When they buy it from you, they pay you for the cookie. If you don’t use it, you have to pay them back. Also, the companies that make these cookies do not make as much money as they make from selling them, because they are not making as many cookies as you do. They have a bigger incentive to do so. So, in essence, if the girls scout cookies company is making more, then they will make less money. I guess it”s because of the advertising, which is why they sell less and sell more. But it doesn‘t matter if it gets the same amount. It makes more for other people, but not more sales. As long as it sells more cookies. No one will buy from them. Tl;dr: it all i hope this helps.

            "[GPT2 Baseline] I think that the earth would be pretty much in the middle of the solar system. However, i'd like to think, that it would still be a matter of some degree of gravity. If you have a planet that is in a low gravity system, you can probably land on it, but if you are on an earth, it's going to have some sort of gravitational effect on your body. I think there is some kind of influence of light. So the question is, how much of an influence is there on the body of a high gravity earth? I'm not sure. There are lots of possibilities. Some of them are obvious, some of those are not. But i don't think you should be too surprised. What do you think?posted by chris at 9:38 am\n",

            "[GPT2 Finetuned] ~~it's not impossible~~ if you jump far enough, you will fall over. The force of gravity is the same on every side of you, so it's possible. But the strength of your fall will be much lower than that of the gravity you are falling on, and you'll experience the equivalent of a massive earthquake.~~ the higher you go, the more likely you become to fall. This is why it is important to not fall on the moon. As you descend, your gravitational force is so weak that the forces of earth and moon cancel out, leaving you with a much greater chance of falling. On earth, gravity can be stronger than on mars. So you can safely jump higher than you would on an earth-sized planet. Edit: i should add that on any planet with no atmosphere, there is a minimum amount of pressure to keep the air from escaping the atmosphere. It would be extremely difficult to land on such a planet without a significant amount. I would not worry about the pressure. However, on other planets, if the planet is very far from the sun, air is not a limiting factor. If it was too thin, it could be dangerous. [here](_url_0_) is an article on air resistance in a gas planetoids. Atmospheric pressure can cause a small change in pressure on top of an atmosphere (this is what causes the effect of air pressure). Edit2: the paper on low pressure, [this paper]( _url](0](http://_1_), [see also](://www._url._1/5/2/0/1/) is on atmospheric density and [wiki](/_url0_. ](_url_-1/-1/_0_-2/_1_-0._) edit3](https://u/u.5/_3/_u._).~~edit3/r/k/i/o/l/s/t/g/h/p/m/f/a/v/d/c/e/x/b/y/z/n/q/on_d_a_at_earth. Jpg on [earth, this would have a very small difference in atmospheric conditions. You might be able to escape. (or not so much so close.](/url_.~~) on some planets it may be easier to get hit by a meteor than others. > or in space. Just a few inches. With the difference would also be difficult, due to the fact that it might not be too hard to hit the surface. A comet or a little more. For a couple of feet. Or something. There might also make landing on something heavier. And not as easy. Maybe a drop in height. ???? Edit 3.1: edit 2: note that at the end, i'm not sure i just for gravity, a bit. In the article it doesn't say it has to go at all. Sorry about this. Also, in general, not that's how it depends on how far it hits the earth. No. At high gravity. Not much. Any given pressure will happen. High pressure would you get pushed down. Even if gravity = 0.4 inches from earth's gravity it will not. Gravity has a slight difference. Tldr: gravity wouldnt. Low enough pressure is also not all at earths. Which would hurt. Please correct me. _not. Edited. To clarify. That. Yes, no gravity might have more pressure and pressure in low. Would kill you fall at any distance. When hit. Is hard. Small. Too small to say hit earth (earth and earth would hit on. Surface? 1.0. Earth at higher pressure = higher. Lower pressure for impact. More impact? 2. Impact could it happens. Pressure of impact 2 = 1/4 of atmosphere pressure? No matter. **edit 2/3 of atmospheric. Same as earth in earth/pressure. 1-1.2 gravity of moon=0 = gravity in atmosphere to planet/earth (more pressure difference of planet=higher pressure (higher) 2 of mass of water. Higher gravity (same distance/higher altitude) of surface gravity/surface of mars = more gravity 2dissolved in gravity(higher). At lower height of ground. All these are the effects will have different pressures. These would apply. Thus yes. Of course the impacts would happen if i am not able. Hit a moon would. Then hit it. Will the iss, or moon = impactor on moon (0,0). If earth > earth=low pressure at impact, yes or impact on surface (in a low gravity on water would cause it to make it a bigger. See it very hard enough to do. Here. *then* a tiny. Some distance at first. Could not happen to\n",
